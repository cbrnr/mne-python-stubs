    2. Window data using ``t_window`` (half before and half after ``t``) and

    3. Use a linear model (DC + linear slope + sin + cos terms) to fit
       sinusoidal amplitudes to MEG channels.
       It uses SVD to determine the phase/amplitude of the sinusoids.

    In "auto" mode, ``t_window`` will be set to the longer of:

    1. Five cycles of the lowest HPI or line frequency.
