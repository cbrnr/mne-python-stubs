        info : mne.Info
            The `mne.Info` object with information about the sensors and methods of measurement.
        ch_type : 'mag' | 'grad' | 'planar1' | 'planar2' | 'eeg' | None
            The channel type to plot. For ``'grad'``, the gradiometers are
            collected in pairs and the RMS for each pair is plotted. If
            ``None`` the first available channel type from order shown above is used. Defaults to ``None``.

            ‚ú® Added in vesion 0.21

        scalings : dict | float | None
            The scalings of the channel types to be applied for plotting.
            If None, defaults to ``dict(eeg=1e6, grad=1e13, mag=1e15)``.

        proj : bool | 'interactive' | 'reconstruct'
            If true SSP projections are applied before display. If 'interactive',
            a check box for reversible selection of SSP projection vectors will
            be shown. If 'reconstruct', projection vectors will be applied and then
            M/EEG data will be reconstructed via field mapping to reduce the signal
            bias caused by projection.

            üé≠ Changed in version 0.21
               Support for 'reconstruct' was added.
        noise_cov : instance of Covariance | None
            If not None, whiten the instance with ``noise_cov`` before
            plotting.

        sensors : bool | str
            Whether to add markers for sensor locations. If `str`, should be a
            valid matplotlib format string (e.g., ``'r+'`` for red plusses, see the
            Notes section of `matplotlib.axes.Axes.plot`). If ``True`` (the
            default), black circles will be used.

        show_names : bool | callable
            If ``True``, show channel names next to each sensor marker. If callable,
            channel names will be formatted using the callable; e.g., to
            delete the prefix 'MEG ' from all channel names, pass the function
            ``lambda x: x.replace('MEG ', '')``. If ``mask`` is not ``None``, only
            non-masked sensor names will be shown.

        mask : ndarray of bool, shape (n_channels,) | None
            Array indicating channel(s) to highlight with a distinct
            plotting style. Array elements set to ``True`` will be plotted
            with the parameters given in ``mask_params``. Defaults to ``None``,
            equivalent to an array of all ``False`` elements.

        mask_params : dict | None
            Additional plotting parameters for plotting significant sensors.
            Default (None) equals::

                dict(marker='o', markerfacecolor='w', markeredgecolor='k',
                        linewidth=0, markersize=4)

        contours : int | array-like
            The number of contour lines to draw. If ``0``, no contours will be drawn.
            If a positive integer, that number of contour levels are chosen using the
            matplotlib tick locator (may sometimes be inaccurate, use array for
            accuracy). If array-like, the array values are used as the contour levels.
            The values should be in ¬µV for EEG, fT for magnetometers and fT/m for
            gradiometers. If ``colorbar=True``, the colorbar will have ticks
            corresponding to the contour levels. Default is ``6``.

        outlines : 'head' | dict | None
            The outlines to be drawn. If 'head', the default head scheme will be
            drawn. If dict, each key refers to a tuple of x and y positions, the values
            in 'mask_pos' will serve as image mask.
            Alternatively, a matplotlib patch object can be passed for advanced
            masking options, either directly or as a function that returns patches
            (required for multi-axis plots). If None, nothing will be drawn.
            Defaults to 'head'.
        sphere : float | array-like | instance of ConductorModel | None  | 'auto' | 'eeglab'
            The sphere parameters to use for the head outline. Can be array-like of
            shape (4,) to give the X/Y/Z origin and radius in meters, or a single float
            to give just the radius (origin assumed 0, 0, 0). Can also be an instance
            of a spherical `mne.bem.ConductorModel` to use the origin and
            radius from that object. If ``'auto'`` the sphere is fit to digitization
            points. If ``'eeglab'`` the head circle is defined by EEG electrodes
            ``'Fpz'``, ``'Oz'``, ``'T7'``, and ``'T8'`` (if ``'Fpz'`` is not present,
            it will be approximated from the coordinates of ``'Oz'``). ``None`` (the
            default) is equivalent to ``'auto'`` when enough extra digitization points
            are available, and (0, 0, 0, 0.095) otherwise.

            ‚ú® Added in vesion 0.20
            üé≠ Changed in version 1.1 Added ``'eeglab'`` option.

        image_interp : str
            The image interpolation to be used. Options are ``'cubic'`` (default)
            to use `scipy.interpolate.CloughTocher2DInterpolator`,
            ``'nearest'`` to use `scipy.spatial.Voronoi` or
            ``'linear'`` to use `scipy.interpolate.LinearNDInterpolator`.

        extrapolate : str
            Options:

            - ``'box'``
                Extrapolate to four points placed to form a square encompassing all
                data points, where each side of the square is three times the range
                of the data in the respective dimension.
            - ``'local'`` (default for MEG sensors)
                Extrapolate only to nearby points (approximately to points closer than
                median inter-electrode distance). This will also set the
                mask to be polygonal based on the convex hull of the sensors.
            - ``'head'`` (default for non-MEG sensors)
                Extrapolate out to the edges of the clipping circle. This will be on
                the head circle when the sensors are contained within the head circle,
                but it can extend beyond the head when sensors are plotted outside
                the head circle.

            üé≠ Changed in version 0.21

               - The default was changed to ``'local'`` for MEG sensors.
               - ``'local'`` was changed to use a convex hull mask
               - ``'head'`` was changed to extrapolate out to the clipping circle.

        border : float | 'mean'
            Value to extrapolate to on the topomap borders. If ``'mean'`` (default),
            then each extrapolated point has the average value of its neighbours.

            ‚ú® Added in vesion 0.20

        res : int
            The resolution of the topomap image (number of pixels along each side).

        size : float
            Side length of each subplot in inches.

        cmap : matplotlib colormap | (colormap, bool) | 'interactive' | None
            Colormap to use. If `tuple`, the first value indicates the colormap
            to use and the second value is a boolean defining interactivity. In
            interactive mode the colors are adjustable by clicking and dragging the
            colorbar with left and right mouse button. Left mouse button moves the
            scale up and down and right mouse button adjusts the range. Hitting
            space bar resets the range. Up and down arrows can be used to change
            the colormap. If ``None``, ``'Reds'`` is used for data that is either
            all-positive or all-negative, and ``'RdBu_r'`` is used otherwise.
            ``'interactive'`` is equivalent to ``(None, True)``. Defaults to ``None``.

            ### ‚õîÔ∏è Warning  Interactive mode works smoothly only for a small amount
                of topomaps. Interactive mode is disabled by default for more than
                2 topomaps.

        vlim : tuple of length 2
            Colormap limits to use. If a `tuple` of floats, specifies the
            lower and upper bounds of the colormap (in that order); providing
            ``None`` for either entry will set the corresponding boundary at the
            min/max of the data. Defaults to ``(None, None)``.

            ‚ú® Added in vesion 1.2

        cnorm : matplotlib.colors.Normalize | None
            How to normalize the colormap. If ``None``, standard linear normalization
            is performed. If not ``None``, ``vmin`` and ``vmax`` will be ignored.
            See `Matplotlib docs <matplotlib:colormapnorms>`
            for more details on colormap normalization, and
            `the ERDs example<cnorm-example>` for an example of its use.

            ‚ú® Added in vesion 1.2

        colorbar : bool
            Plot a colorbar in the rightmost column of the figure.
        cbar_fmt : str
            Formatting string for colorbar tick labels. See `formatspec` for
            details.

        units : dict | str | None
            The units to use for the colorbar label. Ignored if ``colorbar=False``.
            If ``None`` and ``scalings=None`` the unit is automatically determined, otherwise the label will be "AU" indicating arbitrary units.
            Default is ``None``.
        axes : instance of Axes | list of Axes | None
            The axes to plot to. If ``None``, a new `matplotlib.figure.Figure`
            will be created with the correct number of axes. If `matplotlib.axes.Axes` are provided (either as a single instance or a `list` of axes), the number of axes provided must be length 1.Default is ``None``.
        show : bool
            Show the figure if ``True``.

        verbose : bool | str | int | None
            Control verbosity of the logging output. If ``None``, use the default
            verbosity level. See the `logging documentation <tut-logging>` and
            `mne.verbose` for details. Should only be passed as a keyword

    ### üõ†Ô∏è Parameters
    ----------
    raw : instance of Raw
        Raw data.
    tmin : float
        Beginning of time interval in seconds. Defaults to 0.
    tmax : float | None (default None)
        End of time interval in seconds. If None (default), use the end of the
        recording.
    tstep : float (default 0.2)
        Length of data chunks for artifact rejection in seconds.
        Can also be None to use a single epoch of (tmax - tmin)
        duration. This can use a lot of memory for large ``Raw``
        instances.
    reject : dict | None (default None)
        Rejection parameters based on peak-to-peak amplitude.
        Valid keys are 'grad' | 'mag' | 'eeg' | 'eog' | 'ecg'.
        If reject is None then no rejection is done. Example::

            reject = dict(grad=4000e-13, # T / m (gradiometers)
                          mag=4e-12, # T (magnetometers)
                          eeg=40e-6, # V (EEG channels)
                          eog=250e-6 # V (EOG channels)
                          )

    flat : dict | None (default None)
        Rejection parameters based on flatness of signal.
        Valid keys are 'grad' | 'mag' | 'eeg' | 'eog' | 'ecg', and values
        are floats that set the minimum acceptable peak-to-peak amplitude.
        If flat is None then no rejection is done.
    picks : str | array-like | slice | None
        Channels to include. Slices and lists of integers will be interpreted as
        channel indices. In lists, channel *type* strings (e.g., ``['meg',
        'eeg']``) will pick channels of those types, channel *name* strings (e.g.,
        ``['MEG0111', 'MEG2623']`` will pick the given channels. Can also be the
        string values "all" to pick all channels, or "data" to pick :term:`data
        channels`. None (default) will pick good data channels (excluding reference
        MEG channels). Note that channels in ``info['bads']`` *will be included* if
        their names or indices are explicitly provided.
    method : str | list | None (default 'empirical')
        The method used for covariance estimation.
        See `mne.compute_covariance`.

        ‚ú® Added in vesion 0.12
    method_params : dict | None (default None)

        ‚ú® Added in vesion 0.12
    cv : int | sklearn.model_selection object (default 3)
        The cross validation method. Defaults to 3, which will
        internally trigger by default `sklearn.model_selection.KFold`
        with 3 splits.

        ‚ú® Added in vesion 0.12
    scalings : dict | None (default None)
        Defaults to ``dict(mag=1e15, grad=1e13, eeg=1e6)``.
        These defaults will scale magnetometers and gradiometers
        at the same unit.

        ‚ú® Added in vesion 0.12
    n_jobs : int | None
        The number of jobs to run in parallel. If ``-1``, it is set
        to the number of CPU cores. Requires the `joblib` package.
        ``None`` (default) is a marker for 'unset' that will be interpreted
        as ``n_jobs=1`` (sequential execution) unless the call is performed under
        a `joblib:joblib.parallel_config` context manager that sets another
        value for ``n_jobs``.

        ‚ú® Added in vesion 0.12
    return_estimators : bool (default False)
        Whether to return all estimators or the best. Only considered if
        method equals 'auto' or is a list of str. Defaults to False.

        ‚ú® Added in vesion 0.12

    reject_by_annotation : bool
        Whether to reject based on annotations. If ``True`` (default), epochs
        overlapping with segments whose description begins with ``'bad'`` are
        rejected. If ``False``, no rejection based on annotations is performed.

        ‚ú® Added in vesion 0.14

    rank : None | 'info' | 'full' | dict
        This controls the rank computation that can be read from the
        measurement info or estimated from the data. When a noise covariance
        is used for whitening, this should reflect the rank of that covariance,
        otherwise amplification of noise components can occur in whitening (e.g.,
        often during source localization).

        :data:`python:None`
            The rank will be estimated from the data after proper scaling of
            different channel types.
        ``'info'``
            The rank is inferred from ``info``. If data have been processed
            with Maxwell filtering, the Maxwell filtering header is used.
            Otherwise, the channel counts themselves are used.
            In both cases, the number of projectors is subtracted from
            the (effective) number of channels in the data.
            For example, if Maxwell filtering reduces the rank to 68, with
            two projectors the returned value will be 66.
        ``'full'``
            The rank is assumed to be full, i.e. equal to the
            number of good channels. If a `mne.Covariance` is passed, this can
            make sense if it has been (possibly improperly) regularized without
            taking into account the true data rank.
        `dict`
            Calculate the rank only for a subset of channel types, and explicitly
            specify the rank for the remaining channel types. This can be
            extremely useful if you already **know** the rank of (part of) your
            data, for instance in case you have calculated it earlier.

            This parameter must be a dictionary whose **keys** correspond to
            channel types in the data (e.g. ``'meg'``, ``'mag'``, ``'grad'``,
            ``'eeg'``), and whose **values** are integers representing the
            respective ranks. For example, ``{'mag': 90, 'eeg': 45}`` will assume
            a rank of ``90`` and ``45`` for magnetometer data and EEG data,
            respectively.

            The ranks for all channel types present in the data, but
            **not** specified in the dictionary will be estimated empirically.
            That is, if you passed a dataset containing magnetometer, gradiometer,
            and EEG data together with the dictionary from the previous example,
            only the gradiometer rank would be determined, while the specified
            magnetometer and EEG ranks would be taken for granted.

        The default is ``None``.

        `mne.verbose` for details. Should only be passed as a keyword

    cov : instance of Covariance | list
        The computed covariance. If method equals 'auto' or is a list of str
        and return_estimators equals True, a list of covariance estimators is
        returned (sorted by log-likelihood, from high to low, i.e. from best
        to worst).

    This function will:

    2. Load them into memory.
    3. Subtract the mean across all time points and epochs for each channel.
    4. Process the `Epochs` by `compute_covariance`.

    This will produce a slightly different result compared to using
    `make_fixed_length_events`, `Epochs`, and
    `compute_covariance` directly, since that would (with the recommended
    baseline correction) subtract the mean across time *for each epoch*
    (instead of across epochs) for each channel.

    """### Estimate noise covariance matrix from epochs.

    The noise covariance is typically estimated on pre-stimulus periods
    when the stimulus onset is defined from events.

    If the covariance is computed for multiple event types (events
    with different IDs), the following two options can be used and combined:

        1. either an Epochs object for each event type is created and
           a list of Epochs is passed to this function.
        2. an Epochs object is created for multiple events and passed
           to this function.

              as an empty-room recording, use
              `mne.compute_raw_covariance` instead.

    ### üõ†Ô∏è Parameters
    ----------
    epochs : instance of Epochs, or list of Epochs
        The epochs.
    keep_sample_mean : bool (default True)
        If False, the average response over epochs is computed for
        each event type and subtracted during the covariance
        computation. This is useful if the evoked response from a
        previous stimulus extends into the baseline period of the next.
        Note. This option is only implemented for method='empirical'.
    tmin : float | None (default None)
        Start time for baseline. If None start at first sample.
    tmax : float | None (default None)
        End time for baseline. If None end at last sample.
    projs : list of Projection | None (default None)
        List of projectors to use in covariance calculation, or None
        to indicate that the projectors from the epochs should be
        inherited. If None, then projectors from all epochs must match.
    method : str | list | None (default 'empirical')
        The method used for covariance estimation. If 'empirical' (default),
        the sample covariance will be computed. A list can be passed to
        perform estimates using multiple methods.
        If 'auto' or a list of methods, the best estimator will be determined
        based on log-likelihood and cross-validation on unseen data as
        described in :footcite:`EngemannGramfort2015`. Valid methods are
        'empirical', 'diagonal_fixed', 'shrunk', 'oas', 'ledoit_wolf',
        'factor_analysis', 'shrinkage', and 'pca' (see Notes). If ``'auto'``,
        it expands to::

             ['shrunk', 'diagonal_fixed', 'empirical', 'factor_analysis']

        ``'factor_analysis'`` is removed when ``rank`` is not 'full'.
        The ``'auto'`` mode is not recommended if there are many
        segments of data, since computation can take a long time.

        ‚ú® Added in vesion 0.9.0
    method_params : dict | None (default None)
        Additional parameters to the estimation procedure. Only considered if
        method is not None. Keys must correspond to the value(s) of ``method``.
        If None (default), expands to the following (with the addition of
        ``{'store_precision': False, 'assume_centered': True} for all methods
        except ``'factor_analysis'`` and ``'pca'``)::

            {'diagonal_fixed': {'grad': 0.1, 'mag': 0.1, 'eeg': 0.1, ...},
             'shrinkage': {'shrikage': 0.1},
             'shrunk': {'shrinkage': np.logspace(-4, 0, 30)},
             'pca': {'iter_n_components': None},
             'factor_analysis': {'iter_n_components': None}}

    cv : int | sklearn.model_selection object (default 3)
        The cross validation method. Defaults to 3, which will
        internally trigger by default `sklearn.model_selection.KFold`
        with 3 splits.
    scalings : dict | None (default None)
        Defaults to ``dict(mag=1e15, grad=1e13, eeg=1e6)``.
        These defaults will scale data to roughly the same order of
        magnitude.
    n_jobs : int | None
        The number of jobs to run in parallel. If ``-1``, it is set
        to the number of CPU cores. Requires the `joblib` package.
        ``None`` (default) is a marker for 'unset' that will be interpreted
        as ``n_jobs=1`` (sequential execution) unless the call is performed under
        a `joblib:joblib.parallel_config` context manager that sets another
        value for ``n_jobs``.
    return_estimators : bool (default False)
        Whether to return all estimators or the best. Only considered if
        method equals 'auto' or is a list of str. Defaults to False.
    on_mismatch : str
        What to do when the MEG<->Head transformations do not match between
        epochs. If "raise" (default) an error is raised, if "warn" then a
        warning is emitted, if "ignore" then nothing is printed. Having
        mismatched transforms can in some cases lead to unexpected or
        unstable results in covariance calculation, e.g. when data
        have been processed with Maxwell filtering but not transformed
        to the same head position.

    rank : None | 'info' | 'full' | dict
        This controls the rank computation that can be read from the
        measurement info or estimated from the data. When a noise covariance
        is used for whitening, this should reflect the rank of that covariance,
        otherwise amplification of noise components can occur in whitening (e.g.,
        often during source localization).

        :data:`python:None`
            The rank will be estimated from the data after proper scaling of
            different channel types.
        ``'info'``
            The rank is inferred from ``info``. If data have been processed
            with Maxwell filtering, the Maxwell filtering header is used.
            Otherwise, the channel counts themselves are used.
            In both cases, the number of projectors is subtracted from
            the (effective) number of channels in the data.
            For example, if Maxwell filtering reduces the rank to 68, with
            two projectors the returned value will be 66.
        ``'full'``
            The rank is assumed to be full, i.e. equal to the
            number of good channels. If a `mne.Covariance` is passed, this can
            make sense if it has been (possibly improperly) regularized without
            taking into account the true data rank.
        `dict`
            Calculate the rank only for a subset of channel types, and explicitly
            specify the rank for the remaining channel types. This can be
            extremely useful if you already **know** the rank of (part of) your
            data, for instance in case you have calculated it earlier.

            This parameter must be a dictionary whose **keys** correspond to
            channel types in the data (e.g. ``'meg'``, ``'mag'``, ``'grad'``,
            ``'eeg'``), and whose **values** are integers representing the
            respective ranks. For example, ``{'mag': 90, 'eeg': 45}`` will assume
            a rank of ``90`` and ``45`` for magnetometer data and EEG data,
            respectively.

            The ranks for all channel types present in the data, but
            **not** specified in the dictionary will be estimated empirically.
            That is, if you passed a dataset containing magnetometer, gradiometer,
            and EEG data together with the dictionary from the previous example,
            only the gradiometer rank would be determined, while the specified
            magnetometer and EEG ranks would be taken for granted.

        The default is ``None``.

        and ``return_estimators=True``, a list of covariance estimators is
        returned (sorted by log-likelihood, from high to low, i.e. from best
        to worst).

    ### üìñ Notes
    -----
    Baseline correction or sufficient high-passing should be used
    when creating the `Epochs` to ensure that the data are zero mean,
    otherwise the computed covariance matrix will be inaccurate.

    Valid ``method`` strings are:

    * ``'empirical'``
        The empirical or sample covariance (default)
    * ``'diagonal_fixed'``
        A diagonal regularization based on channel types as in
        `mne.cov.regularize`.
    * ``'shrinkage'``
        Fixed shrinkage.

      ‚ú® Added in vesion 0.16
    * ``'ledoit_wolf'``
        The Ledoit-Wolf estimator, which uses an
        empirical formula for the optimal shrinkage value :footcite:`LedoitWolf2004`.
    * ``'oas'``
        The OAS estimator :footcite:`ChenEtAl2010`, which uses a different
        empricial formula for the optimal shrinkage value.

      ‚ú® Added in vesion 0.16
    * ``'shrunk'``
        Like 'ledoit_wolf', but with cross-validation for optimal alpha.
    * ``'pca'``
        Probabilistic PCA with low rank :footcite:`TippingBishop1999`.
    * ``'factor_analysis'``
        Factor analysis with low rank :footcite:`Barber2012`.

    ``'ledoit_wolf'`` and ``'pca'`` are similar to ``'shrunk'`` and
    ``'factor_analysis'``, respectively, except that they use
    cross validation (which is useful when samples are correlated, which
    is often the case for M/EEG data). The former two are not included in
    the ``'auto'`` mode to avoid redundancy.

    For multiple event types, it is also possible to create a
    single `Epochs` object with events obtained using
    `mne.merge_events`. However, the resulting covariance matrix
    will only be correct if ``keep_sample_mean is True``.

    The covariance can be unstable if the number of samples is small.
    In that case it is common to regularize the covariance estimate.
    The ``method`` parameter allows to regularize the covariance in an
    automated way. It also allows to select between different alternative
    estimation algorithms which themselves achieve regularization.
    Details are described in :footcite:t:`EngemannGramfort2015`.

    `the sklearn manual <sklearn:covariance>`.

    ----------
    noise_cov : instance of Covariance
        The noise covariance to process.

    info : mne.Info
        The `mne.Info` object with information about the sensors and methods of measurement. (Used to get channel types and bad channels).

        The channel names to be considered. Can be None to use
        ``info['ch_names']``.

    rank : None | 'info' | 'full' | dict
        This controls the rank computation that can be read from the
        measurement info or estimated from the data. When a noise covariance
        is used for whitening, this should reflect the rank of that covariance,
        otherwise amplification of noise components can occur in whitening (e.g.,
        often during source localization).

        :data:`python:None`
            The rank will be estimated from the data after proper scaling of
            different channel types.
        ``'info'``
            The rank is inferred from ``info``. If data have been processed
            with Maxwell filtering, the Maxwell filtering header is used.
            Otherwise, the channel counts themselves are used.
            In both cases, the number of projectors is subtracted from
            the (effective) number of channels in the data.
            For example, if Maxwell filtering reduces the rank to 68, with
            two projectors the returned value will be 66.
        ``'full'``
            The rank is assumed to be full, i.e. equal to the
            number of good channels. If a `mne.Covariance` is passed, this can
            make sense if it has been (possibly improperly) regularized without
            taking into account the true data rank.
        `dict`
            Calculate the rank only for a subset of channel types, and explicitly
            specify the rank for the remaining channel types. This can be
            extremely useful if you already **know** the rank of (part of) your
            data, for instance in case you have calculated it earlier.

            This parameter must be a dictionary whose **keys** correspond to
            channel types in the data (e.g. ``'meg'``, ``'mag'``, ``'grad'``,
            ``'eeg'``), and whose **values** are integers representing the
            respective ranks. For example, ``{'mag': 90, 'eeg': 45}`` will assume
            a rank of ``90`` and ``45`` for magnetometer data and EEG data,
            respectively.

            The ranks for all channel types present in the data, but
            **not** specified in the dictionary will be estimated empirically.
            That is, if you passed a dataset containing magnetometer, gradiometer,
            and EEG data together with the dictionary from the previous example,
            only the gradiometer rank would be determined, while the specified
            magnetometer and EEG ranks would be taken for granted.

        The default is ``None``.

            dict(mag=1e12, grad=1e11, eeg=1e5)

    on_rank_mismatch : str
        If an explicit MEG value is passed, what to do when it does not match
        an empirically computed rank (only used for covariances).
        Can be 'raise' to raise an error, 'warn' (default) to emit a warning, or

            a rank of ``90`` and ``45`` for magnetometer data and EEG data,
            respectively.

            The ranks for all channel types present in the data, but
            **not** specified in the dictionary will be estimated empirically.
            That is, if you passed a dataset containing magnetometer, gradiometer,
            and EEG data together with the dictionary from the previous example,
            only the gradiometer rank would be determined, while the specified
            magnetometer and EEG ranks would be taken for granted.

        The default is ``None``.

    scalings : dict | None (default None)
        To achieve reliable rank estimation on multiple sensors,
        sensors have to be rescaled. This parameter controls the
        rescaling. If dict, it will override the
        following default dict (default if None):

            dict(mag=1e12, grad=1e11, eeg=1e5)

    verbose : bool | str | int | None
        Control verbosity of the logging output. If ``None``, use the default
        verbosity level. See the `logging documentation <tut-logging>` and
        `mne.verbose` for details. Should only be passed as a keyword
        argument.
