    ----------

    info : mne.Info
        The :class:`mne.Info` object with information about the sensors and methods of measurement.
    kind : str
        Whether to plot the sensors as 3d, topomap or as an interactive
        sensor selection dialog. Available options ``'topomap'``, ``'3d'``,
        ``'select'``. If ``'select'``, a set of channels can be selected
        interactively by using lasso selector or clicking while holding control
        key. The selected channels are returned along with the figure instance.
        Defaults to ``'topomap'``.
    ch_type : None | str
        The channel type to plot. Available options ``'mag'``, ``'grad'``,
        ``'eeg'``, ``'seeg'``, ``'dbs'``, ``'ecog'``, ``'all'``. If ``'all'``,
        all the available mag, grad, eeg, seeg, dbs and ecog channels are
        plotted. If None (default), then channels are chosen in the order given
        above.
    title : str | None
        Title for the figure. If None (default), equals to
        ``'Sensor positions (%s)' % ch_type``.
    show_names : bool | array of str
        Whether to display all channel names. If an array, only the channel
        names in the array are shown. Defaults to False.
    ch_groups : 'position' | list of list | None
        Channel groups for coloring the sensors. If None (default), default
        coloring scheme is used. If 'position', the sensors are divided
        into 8 regions. See ``order`` kwarg of :func:`mne.viz.plot_raw`. If
        array, the channels are divided by picks given in the array. Also
        accepts a list of lists to allow channel groups of the same or
        different sizes.

        .. versionadded:: 0.13.0
    to_sphere : bool
        Whether to project the 3d locations to a sphere. When False, the
        sensor array appears similar as to looking downwards straight above the
        subject's head. Has no effect when ``kind='3d'``. Defaults to True.

        .. versionadded:: 0.14.0

    axes : instance of Axes | instance of Axes3D | None
        Axes to draw the sensors to. If ``kind='3d'``, axes must be an instance
        of Axes3D. If None (default), a new axes will be created.

        .. versionadded:: 0.13.0
    block : bool
        Whether to halt program execution until the figure is closed. Defaults
        to False.

    show : bool
        Show figure if True. Defaults to True.
    sphere : float | array-like | instance of ConductorModel | None  | 'auto' | 'eeglab'
        The sphere parameters to use for the head outline. Can be array-like of
        shape (4,) to give the X/Y/Z origin and radius in meters, or a single float
        to give just the radius (origin assumed 0, 0, 0). Can also be an instance
        of a spherical :class:mne.bem.ConductorModel` to use the origin and
        radius from that object. If ``'auto'`` the sphere is fit to digitization
        points. If ``'eeglab'`` the head circle is defined by EEG electrodes
        ``'Fpz'``, ``'Oz'``, ``'T7'``, and ``'T8'`` (if ``'Fpz'`` is not present,
        it will be approximated from the coordinates of ``'Oz'``). ``None`` (the
        default) is equivalent to ``'auto'`` when enough extra digitization points
        are available, and (0, 0, 0, 0.095) otherwise.

        .. versionadded:: 0.20
        .. versionchanged:: 1.1 Added ``'eeglab'`` option.
    pointsize : float | None
        The size of the points. If None (default), will bet set to ``75`` if
        ``kind='3d'``, or ``25`` otherwise.
    linewidth : float
        The width of the outline. If ``0``, the outline will not be drawn.
    cmap : str | instance of matplotlib.colors.Colormap | None
        Colormap for coloring ch_groups. Has effect only when ``ch_groups``
        is list of list. If None, set to ``matplotlib.rcParams["image.cmap"]``.
        Defaults to None.

    verbose : bool | str | int | None
        Control verbosity of the logging output. If ``None``, use the default
        verbosity level. See the :ref:`logging documentation <tut-logging>` and
