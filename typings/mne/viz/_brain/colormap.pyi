    A colormap may be sequential or divergent. When the colormap is
    divergent indicate this by providing a value for 'center'. The
    meanings of fmin, fmid and fmax are different for sequential and
    divergent colormaps. A sequential colormap is characterised by::

        [fmin, fmid, fmax]

    where fmin and fmax define the edges of the colormap and fmid
    will be the value mapped to the center of the originally chosen colormap.
    A divergent colormap is characterised by::

        [center-fmax, center-fmid, center-fmin, center,
            center+fmin, center+fmid, center+fmax]

    i.e., values between center-fmin and center+fmin will not be shown
    while center-fmid will map to the fmid of the first half of the
    original colormap and center-fmid to the fmid of the second half.

    ### üõ†Ô∏è Parameters

    lim_cmap : Colormap
        Color map obtained from _process_mapdata.
    alpha : float
        Alpha value to apply globally to the overlay. Has no effect with mpl
        backend.
    fmin : float
        Min value in colormap.
    fmid : float
        Intermediate value in colormap.
    fmax : float
        Max value in colormap.
    center : float or None
        If not None, center of a divergent colormap, changes the meaning of
        fmin, fmax and fmid.
    transparent : boolean
        if True: use a linear transparency between fmin and fmid and make
        values below fmin fully transparent (symmetrically for divergent
        colormaps)

    ### ‚èé Returns

    cmap : matplotlib.ListedColormap
        Color map with transparency channel.
