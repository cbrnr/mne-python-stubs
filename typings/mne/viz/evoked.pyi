    Parameters
    ----------
    evoked : instance of Evoked
        The evoked data.
    picks : str | array-like | slice | None
        Channels to include. Slices and lists of integers will be interpreted as
        channel indices. In lists, channel *type* strings (e.g., ``['meg',
        'eeg']``) will pick channels of those types, channel *name* strings (e.g.,
        ``['MEG0111', 'MEG2623']`` will pick the given channels. Can also be the
        string values "all" to pick all channels, or "data" to pick :term:`data
        channels`. None (default) will pick all channels. Note that channels in
        ``info['bads']`` *will be included* if their names or indices are
        explicitly provided.
    exclude : list of str | 'bads'
        Channels names to exclude from being shown. If 'bads', the
        bad channels are excluded.
    unit : bool
        Scale plot with channel (SI) unit.
    show : bool
        Show figure if True.
    ylim : dict | None
        Y limits for plots (after scaling has been applied). e.g.
        ylim = dict(eeg=[-20, 20])
        Valid keys are eeg, mag, grad, misc. If None, the ylim parameter
        for each channel equals the pyplot default.
    xlim : 'tight' | tuple | None
        X limits for plots.

    proj : bool | 'interactive' | 'reconstruct'
        If true SSP projections are applied before display. If 'interactive',
        a check box for reversible selection of SSP projection vectors will
        be shown. If 'reconstruct', projection vectors will be applied and then
        M/EEG data will be reconstructed via field mapping to reduce the signal
        bias caused by projection.

        ðŸŽ­ Changed in version 0.21
           Support for 'reconstruct' was added.
    hline : list of float | None
        The values at which to show an horizontal line.
    units : dict | None
        The units of the channel types used for axes labels. If None,
        defaults to ``dict(eeg='ÂµV', grad='fT/cm', mag='fT')``.
    scalings : dict | None
        The scalings of the channel types to be applied for plotting. If None,
        defaults to ``dict(eeg=1e6, grad=1e13, mag=1e15)``.
    titles : dict | None
        The titles associated with the channels. If None, defaults to
        ``dict(eeg='EEG', grad='Gradiometers', mag='Magnetometers')``.
    axes : instance of Axes | list | None
        The axes to plot to. If list, the list must be a list of Axes of
        the same length as the number of channel types. If instance of
        Axes, there must be only one channel type plotted.
    gfp : bool | 'only'
        Plot the global field power (GFP) or the root mean square (RMS) of the
        data. For MEG data, this will plot the RMS. For EEG, it plots GFP,
        i.e. the standard deviation of the signal across channels. The GFP is
        equivalent to the RMS of an average-referenced signal.

        - ``True``
            Plot GFP or RMS (for EEG and MEG, respectively) and traces for all
            channels.
        - ``'only'``
            Plot GFP or RMS (for EEG and MEG, respectively), and omit the
            traces for individual channels.

        The color of the GFP/RMS trace will be green if
        ``spatial_colors=False``, and black otherwise.

        ðŸŽ­ Changed in version 0.23
           Plot GFP for EEG instead of RMS. Label RMS traces correctly as such.
    window_title : str | None
        The title to put at the top of the figure.
    spatial_colors : bool | 'auto'
        If True, the lines are color coded by mapping physical sensor
        coordinates into color values. Spatially similar channels will have
        similar colors. Bad channels will be dotted. If False, the good
        channels are plotted black and bad channels red. If ``'auto'``, uses
        True if channel locations are present, and False if channel locations
        are missing or if the data contains only a single channel. Defaults to
        ``'auto'``.
    zorder : str | callable
        Which channels to put in the front or back. Only matters if
        ``spatial_colors`` is used.
        If str, must be ``std`` or ``unsorted`` (defaults to ``unsorted``). If
        ``std``, data with the lowest standard deviation (weakest effects) will
        be put in front so that they are not obscured by those with stronger
        effects. If ``unsorted``, channels are z-sorted as in the evoked
        instance.
        If callable, must take one argument: a numpy array of the same
        dimensionality as the evoked raw data; and return a list of
        unique integers corresponding to the number of channels.

        âœ¨ Added in version 0.13.0

    selectable : bool
        Whether to use interactive features. If True (default), it is possible
        to paint an area to draw topomaps. When False, the interactive features
        are disabled. Disabling interactive features reduces memory consumption
        and is useful when using ``axes`` parameter to draw multiaxes figures.

        âœ¨ Added in version 0.13.0

    noise_cov : instance of Covariance | str | None
        Noise covariance used to whiten the data while plotting.
        Whitened data channel names are shown in italic.
        Can be a string to load a covariance from disk.
        See also `mne.Evoked.plot_white` for additional inspection
        of noise covariance properties when whitening evoked data.
        For data processed with SSS, the effective dependence between
        magnetometers and gradiometers may introduce differences in scaling,
        consider using `mne.Evoked.plot_white`.

        âœ¨ Added in version 0.16.0
    time_unit : str
        The units for the time axis, can be "s" (default) or "ms".

        âœ¨ Added in version 0.16
    sphere : float | array-like | instance of ConductorModel | None  | 'auto' | 'eeglab'
        The sphere parameters to use for the head outline. Can be array-like of
        shape (4,) to give the X/Y/Z origin and radius in meters, or a single float
        to give just the radius (origin assumed 0, 0, 0). Can also be an instance
        of a spherical `mne.bem.ConductorModel` to use the origin and
        radius from that object. If ``'auto'`` the sphere is fit to digitization
        points. If ``'eeglab'`` the head circle is defined by EEG electrodes
        ``'Fpz'``, ``'Oz'``, ``'T7'``, and ``'T8'`` (if ``'Fpz'`` is not present,
        it will be approximated from the coordinates of ``'Oz'``). ``None`` (the
        default) is equivalent to ``'auto'`` when enough extra digitization points
        are available, and (0, 0, 0, 0.095) otherwise.

        âœ¨ Added in version 0.20
        ðŸŽ­ Changed in version 1.1 Added ``'eeglab'`` option.
    highlight : array-like of float, shape(2,) | array-like of float, shape (n, 2) | None
        Segments of the data to highlight by means of a light-yellow
        background color. Can be used to put visual emphasis on certain
        time periods. The time periods must be specified as ``array-like``
        objects in the form of ``(t_start, t_end)`` in the unit given by the
        ``time_unit`` parameter.
        Multiple time periods can be specified by passing an ``array-like``
        object of individual time periods (e.g., for 3 time periods, the shape
        of the passed object would be ``(3, 2)``. If ``None``, no highlighting
        is applied.

        âœ¨ Added in version 1.1

    verbose : bool | str | int | None
        Control verbosity of the logging output. If ``None``, use the default
        verbosity level. See the `logging documentation <tut-logging>` and
        `mne.verbose` for details. Should only be passed as a keyword
        argument.

        explicitly provided.
        This parameter can also be used to set the order the channels
        are shown in, as the channel image is sorted by the order of picks.
    exclude : list of str | 'bads'
        Channels names to exclude from being shown. If 'bads', the
        bad channels are excluded.

    show : bool
        Show figure if True.
    clim : dict | None
        Color limits for plots (after scaling has been applied). e.g.
        ``clim = dict(eeg=[-20, 20])``.

        be shown.
    units : dict | None
        The units of the channel types used for axes labels. If None,
        defaults to ``dict(eeg='ÂµV', grad='fT/cm', mag='fT')``.
    scalings : dict | None
        The scalings of the channel types to be applied for plotting. If None,`
        defaults to ``dict(eeg=1e6, grad=1e13, mag=1e15)``.

        Defaults to ``None``.
    cmap : matplotlib colormap | (colormap, bool) | 'interactive'
        Colormap. If tuple, the first value indicates the colormap to use and
        the second value is a boolean defining interactivity. In interactive
        mode the colors are adjustable by clicking and dragging the colorbar

    mask_style : None | 'both' | 'contour' | 'mask'
        If ``mask`` is not None: if 'contour', a contour line is drawn around
        the masked areas (``True`` in ``mask``). If 'mask', entries not
        ``True`` in ``mask`` are shown transparently. If 'both', both a contour
        and transparency are used.
        If ``None``, defaults to 'both' if ``mask`` is not None, and is ignored
        otherwise.

         âœ¨ Added in version 0.16
    mask_cmap : matplotlib colormap | (colormap, bool) | 'interactive'
        The colormap chosen for masked parts of the image (see below), if
        ``mask`` is not ``None``. If None, ``cmap`` is reused. Defaults to
        ``Greys``. Not interactive. Otherwise, as ``cmap``.
    mask_alpha : float
        A float between 0 and 1. If ``mask`` is not None, this sets the
        alpha level (degree of transparency) for the masked-out segments.
        I.e., if 0, masked-out segments are not visible at all.
        Defaults to .25.

    time_unit : str
        The units for the time axis, can be "ms" or "s" (default).

        âœ¨ Added in version 0.16
    show_names : bool | 'auto' | 'all'
        Determines if channel names should be plotted on the y axis. If False,
        no names are shown. If True, ticks are set automatically by matplotlib
        and the corresponding channel names are shown. If "all", all channel
        names are shown. If "auto", is set to False if ``picks`` is ``None``,
        to ``True`` if ``picks`` contains 25 or more entries, or to "all"
        if ``picks`` contains fewer than 25 entries.
    group_by : None | dict
        If a dict, the values must be picks, and ``axes`` must also be a dict
        with matching keys, or None. If ``axes`` is None, one figure and one
        axis will be created for each entry in ``group_by``.Then, for each
        entry, the picked channels will be plotted to the corresponding axis.
        If ``titles`` are None, keys will become plot titles. This is useful
        for e.g. ROIs. Each entry must contain only one channel type.
        For example::

            group_by=dict(Left_ROI=[1, 2, 3, 4], Right_ROI=[5, 6, 7, 8])

        If None, all picked channels are plotted to the same axis.
    sphere : float | array-like | instance of ConductorModel | None  | 'auto' | 'eeglab'
        The sphere parameters to use for the head outline. Can be array-like of
        shape (4,) to give the X/Y/Z origin and radius in meters, or a single float
        to give just the radius (origin assumed 0, 0, 0). Can also be an instance
        of a spherical `mne.bem.ConductorModel` to use the origin and
        radius from that object. If ``'auto'`` the sphere is fit to digitization
        points. If ``'eeglab'`` the head circle is defined by EEG electrodes
        ``'Fpz'``, ``'Oz'``, ``'T7'``, and ``'T8'`` (if ``'Fpz'`` is not present,
        it will be approximated from the coordinates of ``'Oz'``). ``None`` (the

            The rank will be estimated from the data after proper scaling of
            different channel types.
        ``'info'``
            The rank is inferred from ``info``. If data have been processed
            with Maxwell filtering, the Maxwell filtering header is used.
            Otherwise, the channel counts themselves are used.
            In both cases, the number of projectors is subtracted from
            the (effective) number of channels in the data.
            For example, if Maxwell filtering reduces the rank to 68, with
            two projectors the returned value will be 66.
        ``'full'``
            The rank is assumed to be full, i.e. equal to the
            number of good channels. If a `mne.Covariance` is passed, this can
            make sense if it has been (possibly improperly) regularized without
            taking into account the true data rank.
        `dict`
            Calculate the rank only for a subset of channel types, and explicitly
            specify the rank for the remaining channel types. This can be
            extremely useful if you already **know** the rank of (part of) your
            data, for instance in case you have calculated it earlier.

            This parameter must be a dictionary whose **keys** correspond to
            channel types in the data (e.g. ``'meg'``, ``'mag'``, ``'grad'``,
            ``'eeg'``), and whose **values** are integers representing the
            respective ranks. For example, ``{'mag': 90, 'eeg': 45}`` will assume
            a rank of ``90`` and ``45`` for magnetometer data and EEG data,
            respectively.

            The ranks for all channel types present in the data, but
            **not** specified in the dictionary will be estimated empirically.
            That is, if you passed a dataset containing magnetometer, gradiometer,
            and EEG data together with the dictionary from the previous example,
            only the gradiometer rank would be determined, while the specified
            magnetometer and EEG ranks would be taken for granted.

        The default is ``None``.
    time_unit : str
        The units for the time axis, can be "ms" or "s" (default).

    sphere : float | array-like | instance of ConductorModel | None  | 'auto' | 'eeglab'
        The sphere parameters to use for the head outline. Can be array-like of
        shape (4,) to give the X/Y/Z origin and radius in meters, or a single float
        to give just the radius (origin assumed 0, 0, 0). Can also be an instance
        of a spherical `mne.bem.ConductorModel` to use the origin and
        radius from that object. If ``'auto'`` the sphere is fit to digitization
        points. If ``'eeglab'`` the head circle is defined by EEG electrodes
        ``'Fpz'``, ``'Oz'``, ``'T7'``, and ``'T8'`` (if ``'Fpz'`` is not present,
        it will be approximated from the coordinates of ``'Oz'``). ``None`` (the
        default) is equivalent to ``'auto'`` when enough extra digitization points
        are available, and (0, 0, 0, 0.095) otherwise.

    Notes
    -----
    If baseline signals match the assumption of Gaussian white noise,
    values should be centered at 0, and be within 2 standard deviations
    (Â±1.96) for 95% of the time points. For the global field power (GFP),
    we expect it to fluctuate around a value of 1.

    If one single covariance object is passed, the GFP panel (bottom)
    will depict different sensor types. If multiple covariance objects are
    passed as a list, the left column will display the whitened evoked
    responses for each channel based on the whitener from the noise covariance
    that has the highest log-likelihood. The left column will depict the
    whitened GFPs based on each estimator separately for each sensor type.
    Instead of numbers of channels the GFP display shows the estimated rank.
    Note. The rank estimation will be printed by the logger
    (if ``verbose=True``) for each noise covariance estimator that is passed.

    colors : list | dict | None
        Colors to use when plotting the ERP/F lines and confidence bands. If
        ``cmap`` is not ``None``, ``colors`` must be a `list` or
        `dict` of `ints <int>` or `floats <float>`
        indicating steps or percentiles (respectively) along the colormap. If
        ``cmap`` is ``None``, list elements or dict values of ``colors`` must
        be `ints <int>` or valid `matplotlib colors
        <matplotlib:colors_def>`; lists are cycled through
        sequentially,
        while dicts must have keys matching the keys or conditions of an
        ``evokeds`` dict (see Notes for details). If ``None``, the current
        :doc:`matplotlib color cycle
        <matplotlib:gallery/color/color_cycle_default>`
        is used. Defaults to ``None``.
    linestyles : list | dict | None
        Styles to use when plotting the ERP/F lines. If a `list` or
        `dict`, elements must be valid :doc:`matplotlib linestyles
        <matplotlib:gallery/lines_bars_and_markers/linestyles>`. Lists are
        cycled through sequentially; dictionaries must have keys matching the
        keys or conditions of an ``evokeds`` dict (see Notes for details). If
        ``None``, all lines will be solid. Defaults to ``None``.
    styles : dict | None
        Dictionary of styles to use when plotting ERP/F lines. Keys must match
        keys or conditions of ``evokeds``, and values must be a `dict`
        of legal inputs to `matplotlib.pyplot.plot`. Those values will be
        passed as parameters to the line plot call of the corresponding
        condition, overriding defaults (e.g.,
        ``styles={"Aud/L": {"linewidth": 3}}`` will set the linewidth for
        "Aud/L" to 3). As with ``colors`` and ``linestyles``, keys matching
        conditions in ``/``-separated ``evokeds`` keys are supported (see Notes
        for details).
    cmap : None | str | tuple | instance of matplotlib.colors.Colormap
        Colormap from which to draw color values when plotting the ERP/F lines
        and confidence bands. If not ``None``, ints or floats in the ``colors``
        parameter are mapped to steps or percentiles (respectively) along the
        colormap. If ``cmap`` is a `str`, it will be passed to
        ``matplotlib.colormaps``; if ``cmap`` is a tuple, its first
        element will be used as a string to label the colorbar, and its
        second element will be passed to ``matplotlib.colormaps`` (unless
        it is already an instance of `matplotlib.colors.Colormap`).

        ðŸŽ­ Changed in version 0.19

    vlines : "auto" | list of float
        A list in seconds at which to plot dashed vertical lines.
        If "auto" and the supplied data includes 0, it is set to [0.]
        and a vertical bar is plotted at time 0. If an empty list is passed,
        no vertical lines are plotted.
    ci : float | bool | callable | None
        Confidence band around each ERP/F time series. If ``False`` or ``None``
        no confidence band is drawn. If `float`, ``ci`` must be between
        0 and 1, and will set the threshold for a bootstrap
        (single plot)/parametric (when ``axes=='topo'``)  estimation of the
        confidence band; ``True`` is equivalent to setting a threshold of 0.95
        (i.e., the 95% confidence band is drawn). If a callable, it must take
        a single array (n_observations Ã— n_times) as input and return upper and
        lower confidence margins (2 Ã— n_times). Defaults to ``True``.
    truncate_yaxis : bool | 'auto'
        Whether to shorten the y-axis spine. If 'auto', the spine is truncated
        at the minimum and maximum ticks. If ``True``, it is truncated at the
        multiple of 0.25 nearest to half the maximum absolute value of the
        data. If ``truncate_xaxis=False``, only the far bound of the y-axis
        will be truncated. Defaults to 'auto'.
    truncate_xaxis : bool
        Whether to shorten the x-axis spine. If ``True``, the spine is
        truncated at the minimum and maximum ticks. If
        ``truncate_yaxis=False``, only the far bound of the x-axis will be
        truncated. Defaults to ``True``.
    ylim : dict | None
        Y-axis limits for plots (after scaling has been applied). `dict`
        keys should match channel types; valid keys are eeg, mag, grad, misc
        (example: ``ylim=dict(eeg=[-20, 20])``). If ``None``, the y-axis limits
        will be set automatically by matplotlib. Defaults to ``None``.
    invert_y : bool
        Whether to plot negative values upward (as is sometimes done
        for ERPs out of tradition). Defaults to ``False``.
    show_sensors : bool | int | str | None
        Whether to display an inset showing sensor locations on a head outline.
        If `int` or `str`, indicates position of the inset (see
        `mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1.inset_locator.inset_axes`). If ``None``,
        treated as ``True`` if there is only one channel in ``picks``. If
        ``True``, location is upper or lower right corner, depending on data
        values. Defaults to ``None``.
    legend : bool | int | str
        Whether to show a legend for the colors/linestyles of the conditions
        plotted. If `int` or `str`, indicates position of the
        legend (see `mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1.inset_locator.inset_axes`).
        If ``True``, equivalent to ``'upper left'``. Defaults to ``True``.
    split_legend : bool | None
        Whether to separate color and linestyle in the legend. If ``None``,
        a separate linestyle legend will still be shown if ``cmap`` is
        specified. Defaults to ``None``.
    axes : None | Axes instance | list of Axes | 'topo'
        `matplotlib.axes.Axes` object to plot into. If plotting
        multiple channel types (or multiple channels when ``combine=None``),
        ``axes`` should be a list of appropriate length containing
        `matplotlib.axes.Axes` objects. If ``'topo'``, a new
        `matplotlib.figure.Figure` is created with one axis for each
        channel, in a topographical layout. If ``None``, a new
        `matplotlib.figure.Figure` is created for each channel type.
        Defaults to ``None``.
    title : str | None
        Title printed above the plot. If ``None``, a title will be
        automatically generated based on channel name(s) or type(s) and the
        value of the ``combine`` parameter. Defaults to ``None``.
    show : bool
        Whether to show the figure. Defaults to ``True``.

    combine : None | str | callable
        How to combine information across channels. If a `str`, must be
        one of 'mean', 'median', 'std' (standard deviation) or 'gfp' (global
        field power).
        If callable, the callable must accept one positional input (data of
        shape ``(n_evokeds, n_channels, n_times)``) and return an
        `array <numpy.ndarray>` of shape ``(n_epochs, n_times)``. For
        example::

            combine = lambda data: np.median(data, axis=1)

        If ``combine`` is ``None``, channels are combined by computing GFP,
        unless ``picks`` is a single channel (not channel type) or
        ``axes='topo'``, in which cases no combining is performed. Defaults to
        ``None``.
    sphere : float | array-like | instance of ConductorModel | None  | 'auto' | 'eeglab'
        The sphere parameters to use for the head outline. Can be array-like of
        shape (4,) to give the X/Y/Z origin and radius in meters, or a single float
        to give just the radius (origin assumed 0, 0, 0). Can also be an instance
        of a spherical `mne.bem.ConductorModel` to use the origin and
        radius from that object. If ``'auto'`` the sphere is fit to digitization
        points. If ``'eeglab'`` the head circle is defined by EEG electrodes
        ``'Fpz'``, ``'Oz'``, ``'T7'``, and ``'T8'`` (if ``'Fpz'`` is not present,
        it will be approximated from the coordinates of ``'Oz'``). ``None`` (the
        default) is equivalent to ``'auto'`` when enough extra digitization points
        are available, and (0, 0, 0, 0.095) otherwise.

        âœ¨ Added in version 0.20

    time_unit : str
        The units for the time axis, can be "s" (default) or "ms".

        âœ¨ Added in version 1.1

    Returns
    -------
    fig : list of Figure instances
        A list of the figure(s) generated.

    Notes
    -----
    If the parameters ``styles``, ``colors``, or ``linestyles`` are passed as
    `dicts <python:dict>`, then ``evokeds`` must also be a
    `python:dict`, and
    the keys of the plot-style parameters must either match the keys of
    ``evokeds``, or match a ``/``-separated partial key ("condition") of
    ``evokeds``. For example, if evokeds has keys "Aud/L", "Aud/R", "Vis/L",
    and "Vis/R", then ``linestyles=dict(L='--', R='-')`` will plot both Aud/L
    and Vis/L conditions with dashed lines and both Aud/R and Vis/R conditions
    with solid lines. Similarly, ``colors=dict(Aud='r', Vis='b')`` will plot
    Aud/L and Aud/R conditions red and Vis/L and Vis/R conditions blue.

    Color specification depends on whether a colormap has been provided in the
    ``cmap`` parameter. The following table summarizes how the ``colors``
    parameter is interpreted:
