    First, all channels that are not common to each object are dropped. Then,
    using the first object in the list as a template, the channels of each

    given objects define the same channels, in the same order.

    ### üõ†Ô∏è Parameters
    ----------
    instances : list
        A list of MNE-Python objects to equalize the channels for. Objects can

        When dropping and/or re-ordering channels, an object will be copied

        ### üìñ Notes
        -----
        Some common referencing schemes and the corresponding value for the
        ``ref_channels`` parameter:

        - Average reference:
            A new virtual reference electrode is created by averaging the current
            EEG signal by setting ``ref_channels='average'``. Bad EEG channels are
            automatically excluded if they are properly set in ``info['bads']``.

        - A single electrode:
            Set ``ref_channels`` to a list containing the name of the channel that
            will act as the new reference, for example ``ref_channels=['Cz']``.

        - The mean of multiple electrodes:
            A new virtual reference electrode is created by computing the average
            of the current EEG signal recorded from two or more selected channels.
            Set ``ref_channels`` to a list of channel names, indicating which
            channels to use. For example, to apply an average mastoid reference,
            when using the 10-20 naming scheme, set ``ref_channels=['M1', 'M2']``.

        - REST
            The given EEG electrodes are referenced to a point at infinity using the
            lead fields in ``forward``, which helps standardize the signals.

        1. If a reference is requested that is not the average reference, this
           function removes any pre-existing average reference projections.

        2. During source localization, the EEG signal should have an average
           reference.

        3. In order to apply a reference, the data must be preloaded. This is not
           necessary if ``ref_channels='average'`` and ``projection=True``.

        4. For an average or REST reference, bad EEG channels are automatically
           excluded if they are properly set in ``info['bads']``.

            Origin of the sphere in the head coordinate frame and in meters.

    ‚ú® Added in vesion 0.15

    Automatic detection of an appropriate adjacency matrix template only

    is always computed for EEG data and never loaded from a template file. If
    you want to load a template for a given montage use
    `read_ch_adjacency` directly.

    ### ‚õîÔ∏è Warning
        If Delaunay triangulation is used to calculate the adjacency matrix it
        may yield partially unexpected results (e.g., include unwanted edges
        between non-adjacent sensors). Therefore, it is recommended to check
        (and, if necessary, manually modify) the result by inspecting it

    use_cal : bool

    -----
    This function changes magnetometer coil types 3022 (T1: SQ20483N) and
    3023 (T2: SQ20483-A) to 3024 (T3: SQ20950N) in the channel definition

    Neuromag Vectorview systems can contain magnetometers with two
    different coil sizes (3022 and 3023 vs. 3024). The systems
    incorporating coils of type 3024 were introduced last and are used at
    the majority of MEG sites. At some sites with 3024 magnetometers,
    the data files have still defined the magnetometers to be of type
    3022 to ensure compatibility with older versions of Neuromag software.
    In the MNE software as well as in the present version of Neuromag
    software coil type 3024 is fully supported. Therefore, it is now safe
    to upgrade the data files to use the true coil type.

    ### üí° Note The effect of the difference between the coil sizes on the
              current estimates computed by the MNE software is very small.
              Therefore the use of ``fix_mag_coil_types`` is not mandatory.
