        hpi_weight : float
            Relative weight for HPI. The default value is 1.
        callback : callable | None
            A function to call on each iteration. Useful for status message
            updates. It will be passed the keyword arguments ``iteration``
            and ``n_iterations``.

        verbose : bool | str | int | None
            Control verbosity of the logging output. If ``None``, use the default
            verbosity level. See the `logging documentation <tut-logging>` and
            `mne.verbose` for details. Should only be passed as a keyword
            argument.
