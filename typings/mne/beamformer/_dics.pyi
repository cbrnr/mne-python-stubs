    """## üß† Compute a Dynamic Imaging of Coherent Sources (DICS) spatial filter.

    This is a beamformer filter that can be used to estimate the source power
    at a specific frequency range :footcite:`GrossEtAl2001`. It does this by
    constructing a spatial filter for each source point.
    The computation of these filters is very similar to those of the LCMV
    beamformer (`make_lcmv`), but instead of operating on a covariance
    matrix, the CSD matrix is used. When applying these filters to a CSD matrix
    (see `apply_dics_csd`), the source power can be estimated for each
    source point.

    ### üõ†Ô∏è Parameters


    #### `info : mne.Info`
        The `mne.Info` object with information about the sensors and methods of measurement.
    #### `forward : instance of Forward`
        Forward operator.
    #### `csd : instance of CrossSpectralDensity`
        The data cross-spectral density (CSD) matrices. A source estimate is
        performed for each frequency or frequency-bin defined in the CSD
        object.
    #### `reg : float`
        The regularization to apply to the cross-spectral density before
        computing the inverse.
    #### `noise_csd : instance of CrossSpectralDensity | None`
        Noise cross-spectral density (CSD) matrices. If provided, whitening
        will be done. The noise CSDs need to have been computed for the same
        frequencies as the data CSDs. Providing noise CSDs is mandatory if you
        mix sensor types, e.g. gradiometers with magnetometers or EEG with
        MEG.

        ‚ú® Added in vesion 0.20
    #### `label : Label | None`
        Restricts the solution to a given label.

    #### `pick_ori : None | str`
        For forward solutions with fixed orientation, None (default) must be
        used and a scalar beamformer is computed. For free-orientation forward
        solutions, a vector beamformer is computed and:

        - ``None``
            Orientations are pooled after computing a vector beamformer (Default).
        - ``'normal'``
            Filters are computed for the orientation tangential to the
            cortical surface.
        - ``'max-power'``
            Filters are computed for the orientation that maximizes power.

    #### `rank : None | 'info' | 'full' | dict`
        This controls the rank computation that can be read from the
        measurement info or estimated from the data. When a noise covariance
        is used for whitening, this should reflect the rank of that covariance,
        otherwise amplification of noise components can occur in whitening (e.g.,
        often during source localization).

        :data:`python:None`
            The rank will be estimated from the data after proper scaling of
            different channel types.
        ``'info'``
            The rank is inferred from ``info``. If data have been processed
            with Maxwell filtering, the Maxwell filtering header is used.
            Otherwise, the channel counts themselves are used.
            In both cases, the number of projectors is subtracted from
            the (effective) number of channels in the data.
            For example, if Maxwell filtering reduces the rank to 68, with
            two projectors the returned value will be 66.
        ``'full'``
            The rank is assumed to be full, i.e. equal to the
            number of good channels. If a `mne.Covariance` is passed, this can
            make sense if it has been (possibly improperly) regularized without
            taking into account the true data rank.
        `dict`
            Calculate the rank only for a subset of channel types, and explicitly
            specify the rank for the remaining channel types. This can be
            extremely useful if you already `know` the rank of (part of) your
            data, for instance in case you have calculated it earlier.

            This parameter must be a dictionary whose `keys` correspond to
            channel types in the data (e.g. ``'meg'``, ``'mag'``, ``'grad'``,
            ``'eeg'``), and whose `values` are integers representing the
            respective ranks. For example, ``{'mag': 90, 'eeg': 45}`` will assume
            a rank of ``90`` and ``45`` for magnetometer data and EEG data,
            respectively.

            The ranks for all channel types present in the data, but
            `not` specified in the dictionary will be estimated empirically.
            That is, if you passed a dataset containing magnetometer, gradiometer,
            and EEG data together with the dictionary from the previous example,
            only the gradiometer rank would be determined, while the specified
            magnetometer and EEG ranks would be taken for granted.

        The default is ``None``.

        ‚ú® Added in vesion 0.17

    #### `weight_norm : str | None`
        Can be:

        - ``None``
            The unit-gain LCMV beamformer :footcite:`SekiharaNagarajan2008` will be
            computed.
        - ``'unit-noise-gain'``
            The unit-noise gain minimum variance beamformer will be computed
            (Borgiotti-Kaplan beamformer) :footcite:`SekiharaNagarajan2008`,
            which is not rotation invariant when ``pick_ori='vector'``.
            This should be combined with
            `stc.project('pca') <mne.VectorSourceEstimate.project>` to follow
            the definition in :footcite:`SekiharaNagarajan2008`.
        - ``'nai'``
            The Neural Activity Index :footcite:`VanVeenEtAl1997` will be computed,
            which simply scales all values from ``'unit-noise-gain'`` by a fixed
            value.
        - ``'unit-noise-gain-invariant'``
            Compute a rotation-invariant normalization using the matrix square
            root. This differs from ``'unit-noise-gain'`` only when
            ``pick_ori='vector'``, creating a solution that:

            1. Is rotation invariant (``'unit-noise-gain'`` is not);
            2. Satisfies the first requirement from
               :footcite:`SekiharaNagarajan2008` that ``w @ w.conj().T == I``,
               whereas ``'unit-noise-gain'`` has non-zero off-diagonals; but
            3. Does not satisfy the second requirement that ``w @ G.T = Œ∏I``,
               which arguably does not make sense for a rotation-invariant
               solution.

        Defaults to ``None``, in which case no normalization is performed.

    #### `reduce_rank : bool`
        If True, the rank of the denominator of the beamformer formula (i.e.,
        during pseudo-inversion) will be reduced by one for each spatial location.
        Setting ``reduce_rank=True`` is typically necessary if you use a single
        sphere model with MEG data.

        üé≠ Changed in version 0.20
            Support for reducing rank in all modes (previously only supported
            ``pick='max_power'`` with weight normalization).

    #### `depth : None | float | dict`
        How to weight (or normalize) the forward using a depth prior.
        If float (default 0.8), it acts as the depth weighting exponent (``exp``)
        to use None is equivalent to 0, meaning no depth weighting is performed.
        It can also be a `dict` containing keyword arguments to pass to
        `mne.forward.compute_depth_prior` (see docstring for details and
        defaults). This is effectively ignored when ``method='eLORETA'``.

        üé≠ Changed in version 0.20
           Depth bias ignored for ``method='eLORETA'``.
    #### `real_filter : bool`
        If ``True``, take only the real part of the cross-spectral-density
        matrices to compute real filters.

        üé≠ Changed in version 0.23
            Version 0.23 an earlier used ``real_filter=False`` as the default,
            as of version 0.24 ``True`` is the default.

    #### `inversion : 'single' | 'matrix'`
        This determines how the beamformer deals with source spaces in "free"
        orientation. Such source spaces define three orthogonal dipoles at each
        source point. When ``inversion='single'``, each dipole is considered
        as an individual source and the corresponding spatial filter is
        computed for each dipole separately. When ``inversion='matrix'``, all
        three dipoles at a source vertex are considered as a group and the
        spatial filters are computed jointly using a matrix inversion. While
        ``inversion='single'`` is more stable, ``inversion='matrix'`` is more
        precise. See section 5 of :footcite:`vanVlietEtAl2018`.
        Defaults to ``'matrix'``.

        üé≠ Changed in version 0.21
           Default changed to ``'matrix'``.

    #### `verbose : bool | str | int | None`
        Control verbosity of the logging output. If ``None``, use the default
        verbosity level. See the `logging documentation <tut-logging>` and
        `mne.verbose` for details. Should only be passed as a keyword
        argument.

    ### üìñ Notes

    The original reference is :footcite:`GrossEtAl2001`. See
    :footcite:`vanVlietEtAl2018` for a tutorial style paper on the topic.

    The DICS beamformer is very similar to the LCMV (`make_lcmv`)
    beamformer and many of the parameters are shared. However,
    `make_dics` and `make_lcmv` currently have different defaults
    for these parameters, which were settled on separately through extensive
    practical use case testing (but not necessarily exhaustive parameter space
    searching), and it remains to be seen how functionally interchangeable they
    could be.

    The default setting reproduce the DICS beamformer as described in
    :footcite:`vanVlietEtAl2018`::

        inversion='single', weight_norm=None, depth=1.

    To use the `make_lcmv` defaults, use::

        inversion='matrix', weight_norm='unit-noise-gain-invariant', depth=None

    For more information about ``real_filter``, see the
    supplemental information from :footcite:`HippEtAl2011`.
