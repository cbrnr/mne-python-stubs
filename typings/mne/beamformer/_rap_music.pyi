    ### üõ†Ô∏è Parameters

    #### `evoked : instance of Evoked`
        Evoked data to localize.
    #### `forward : instance of Forward`
        Forward operator.
    #### `noise_cov : instance of Covariance`
        The noise covariance.
    #### `n_dipoles : int`
        The number of dipoles to look for. The default value is 5.
    #### `return_residual : bool`
        If True, the residual is returned as an Evoked instance.

    #### `verbose : bool | str | int | None`
        Control verbosity of the logging output. If ``None``, use the default
        verbosity level. See the `logging documentation <tut-logging>` and
        `mne.verbose` for details. Should only be passed as a keyword
        argument.

    -----
    ### ‚èé Returns

    #### `dipoles : list of instance of Dipole`
        The dipole fits.
    #### `residual : instance of Evoked`
        The residual a.k.a. data not explained by the dipoles.
        Only returned if return_residual is True.
