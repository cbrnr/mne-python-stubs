class Forward(dict):
    """### Forward class to represent info from forward solution.

    Like `mne.Info`, this data structure behaves like a dictionary.
    It contains all metadata necessary for a forward solution.

    ### ‚õîÔ∏è Warning
        This class should not be modified or created by users.
        Forward objects should be obtained using
        `mne.make_forward_solution` or `mne.read_forward_solution`.

    ### üìä Attributes
    ----------
    ch_names : list of str
        A convenience wrapper accessible as ``fwd.ch_names`` which wraps
        ``fwd['info']['ch_names']``.

    ### üëâ See Also
    --------

    mne.read_forward_solution

    ### üìñ Notes
    -----
    Forward data is accessible via string keys using standard
    `python:dict` access (e.g., ``fwd['nsource'] == 4096``):

        source_ori : int
            The source orientation, either ``FIFF.FIFFV_MNE_FIXED_ORI`` or
            ``FIFF.FIFFV_MNE_FREE_ORI``.
        coord_frame : int
            The coordinate frame of the forward solution, usually
            ``FIFF.FIFFV_COORD_HEAD``.
        nsource : int
            The number of source locations.
        nchan : int
            The number of channels.
        sol : dict
            The forward solution, with entries:

            ``'data'`` : ndarray, shape (n_channels, nsource * n_ori)
                The forward solution data. The shape will be
                ``(n_channels, nsource)`` for a fixed-orientation forward and
                ``(n_channels, nsource * 3)`` for a free-orientation forward.
            ``'row_names'`` : list of str
                The channel names.
        mri_head_t : instance of Transform
            The mri ‚Üî head transformation that was used.
        info : instance of `mne.Info`
            The measurement information (with contents reduced compared to that
            of the original data).
        src : instance of `mne.SourceSpaces`
            The source space used during forward computation. This can differ
            from the original source space as:

            1. Source points are removed due to proximity to (or existing
               outside)
               the inner skull surface.
            2. The source space will be converted to the ``coord_frame`` of the
               forward solution, which typically means it gets converted from
               MRI to head coordinates.
        source_rr : ndarray, shape (n_sources, 3)
            The source locations.
        source_nn : ndarray, shape (n_sources, 3)
            The source normals. Will be all +Z (``(0, 0, 1.)``) for volume
            source spaces. For surface source spaces, these are normal to the
            cortical surface.
        surf_ori : int
            Whether ``sol`` is surface-oriented with the surface normal in the
            Z component (``FIFF.FIFFV_MNE_FIXED_ORI``) or +Z in the given
            ``coord_frame`` in the Z component (``FIFF.FIFFV_MNE_FREE_ORI``).

    Forward objects also have some attributes that are accessible via ``.``
    access, like ``fwd.ch_names``.

    rank : None | 'info' | 'full' | dict
        This controls the rank computation that can be read from the
        measurement info or estimated from the data. When a noise covariance
        is used for whitening, this should reflect the rank of that covariance,
        otherwise amplification of noise components can occur in whitening (e.g.,
        often during source localization).

        :data:`python:None`
            The rank will be estimated from the data after proper scaling of
            different channel types.
        ``'info'``
            The rank is inferred from ``info``. If data have been processed
            with Maxwell filtering, the Maxwell filtering header is used.
            Otherwise, the channel counts themselves are used.
            In both cases, the number of projectors is subtracted from
            the (effective) number of channels in the data.
            For example, if Maxwell filtering reduces the rank to 68, with
            two projectors the returned value will be 66.
        ``'full'``
            The rank is assumed to be full, i.e. equal to the
            number of good channels. If a `mne.Covariance` is passed, this can
            make sense if it has been (possibly improperly) regularized without
            taking into account the true data rank.
        `dict`
            Calculate the rank only for a subset of channel types, and explicitly
            specify the rank for the remaining channel types. This can be
            extremely useful if you already **know** the rank of (part of) your
            data, for instance in case you have calculated it earlier.

            This parameter must be a dictionary whose **keys** correspond to
            channel types in the data (e.g. ``'meg'``, ``'mag'``, ``'grad'``,
            ``'eeg'``), and whose **values** are integers representing the
            respective ranks. For example, ``{'mag': 90, 'eeg': 45}`` will assume
            a rank of ``90`` and ``45`` for magnetometer data and EEG data,
            respectively.

            The ranks for all channel types present in the data, but
            **not** specified in the dictionary will be estimated empirically.
            That is, if you passed a dataset containing magnetometer, gradiometer,
            and EEG data together with the dictionary from the previous example,
            only the gradiometer rank would be determined, while the specified
            magnetometer and EEG ranks would be taken for granted.

        The default is ``None``.

    ### üìñ Notes
    -----
    The defaults used by the minimum norm code and sparse solvers differ.
    In particular, the values for MNE are::

        compute_depth_prior(..., limit=10., limit_depth_chs=True,
                            combine_xyz='spectral')

    In sparse solvers and LCMV, the values are::

        compute_depth_prior(..., limit=None, limit_depth_chs='whiten',
                            combine_xyz='fro')

    The ``limit_depth_chs`` argument can take the following values:

    * :data:`python:True` (default)
          Use only grad channels in depth weighting (equivalent to MNE C
          minimum-norm code). If grad channels aren't present, only mag
          channels will be used (if no mag, then eeg). This makes the depth
          prior dependent only on the sensor geometry (and relationship
          to the sources).
    * ``'whiten'``
          Compute a whitener and apply it to the gain matrix before computing
          the depth prior. In this case ``noise_cov`` must not be None.
          Whitening the gain matrix makes the depth prior
          depend on both sensor geometry and the data of interest captured
          by the noise covariance (e.g., projections, SNR).

          ‚ú® Added in vesion 0.18
    * :data:`python:False`
          Use all channels. Not recommended since the depth weighting will be
          biased toward whichever channel type has the largest values in
          SI units (such as EEG being orders of magnitude larger than MEG).

    """### Project source space currents to sensor space using a forward operator.

    The sensor space data is computed for all channels present in fwd. Use
    pick_channels_forward or pick_types_forward to restrict the solution to a
    subset of channels.

    The function returns a Raw object, which is constructed using provided
    info. The info object should be from the same MEG system on which the
    original data was acquired. An exception will be raised if the forward
    operator contains channels that are not present in the info.

    ### üõ†Ô∏è Parameters
    ----------
    fwd : Forward
        Forward operator to use.
    stc : SourceEstimate
        The source estimate from which the sensor space data is computed.

    info : mne.Info
        The `mne.Info` object with information about the sensors and methods of measurement.
    start : int, optional
        Index of first time sample (index not time is seconds).
    stop : int, optional
        Index of first time sample not to include (index not time is seconds).

    on_missing : 'raise' | 'warn' | 'ignore'
        Can be ``'raise'`` (default) to raise an error, ``'warn'`` to emit a
        warning, or ``'ignore'`` to ignore when ``stc`` has vertices that are not in ``fwd``.
        Default is "raise".

    use_cps : bool
        Whether to use cortical patch statistics to define normal orientations for
        surfaces (default True).
