    ### üìñ Notes
    -----

    The Morlet wavelets follow the formulation in :footcite:t:`Tallon-BaudryEtAl1997`.

    Convolution of a signal with a Morlet wavelet will impose temporal smoothing
    that is determined by the duration of the wavelet. In MNE-Python, the duration
    of the wavelet is determined by the ``sigma`` parameter, which gives the
    standard deviation of the wavelet's Gaussian envelope (our wavelets extend to
    ¬±5 standard deviations to ensure values very close to zero at the endpoints).
    Some authors (e.g., :footcite:t:`Cohen2019`) recommend specifying and reporting
    wavelet duration in terms of the full-width half-maximum (FWHM) of the
    wavelet's Gaussian envelope. The FWHM is related to ``sigma`` by the following
    identity: :math:`\\mathrm{FWHM} = \\sigma \\times 2 \\sqrt{2 \\ln{2}}` (or the
    equivalent in Python code: ``fwhm = sigma * 2 * np.sqrt(2 * np.log(2))``).
    If ``sigma`` is not provided, it is computed from ``n_cycles`` as
    :math:`\\frac{\\mathtt{n\\_cycles}}{2 \\pi f}` where :math:`f` is the frequency of
    the wavelet oscillation (given by ``freqs``). Thus when ``sigma=None`` the FWHM
    will be given by

    .. math::

        \\mathrm{FWHM} = \\frac{\\mathtt{n\\_cycles} \\times \\sqrt{2 \\ln{2}}}{\\pi \\times f}

    (cf. eq. 4 in :footcite:`Cohen2019`). To create wavelets with a chosen FWHM,
    one can compute::

        n_cycles = desired_fwhm * np.pi * np.array(freqs) / np.sqrt(2 * np.log(2))

    to get an array of values for ``n_cycles`` that yield the desired FWHM at each
    frequency in ``freqs``.  If you want different FWHM values at each frequency,
    do the same computation with ``desired_fwhm`` as an array of the same shape as
    ``freqs``.

    The Morlet wavelets follow the formulation in :footcite:t:`Tallon-BaudryEtAl1997`.

    In spectrotemporal analysis (as with traditional fourier methods),
    the temporal and spectral resolution are interrelated: longer temporal windows
    allow more precise frequency estimates; shorter temporal windows "smear"
    frequency estimates while providing more precise timing information.

    Time-frequency representations are computed using a sliding temporal window.
    Either the temporal window has a fixed length independent of frequency, or the
    temporal window decreases in length with increased frequency.

    *Figure: Time and frequency smoothing. (a) For a fixed length temporal window

    decrease with frequency, the temporal smoothing decreases and the frequency
    smoothing increases with frequency.*

    In MNE-Python, the length of the Morlet wavelet is affected by the arguments
    ``freqs`` and ``n_cycles``, which define the frequencies of interest
    and the number of cycles, respectively. For the time-frequency representation,
    the length of the wavelet is defined such that both tails of
    the wavelet extend five standard deviations from the midpoint of its Gaussian
    envelope and that there is a sample at time zero.

    The length of the wavelet is thus :math:`10\\times\\mathtt{sfreq}\\cdot\\sigma-1`,
    which is equal to :math:`\\frac{5}{\\pi} \\cdot \\frac{\\mathtt{n\\_cycles} \\cdot
    \\mathtt{sfreq}}{\\mathtt{freqs}} - 1`, where
    :math:`\\sigma = \\frac{\\mathtt{n\\_cycles}}{2\\pi f}` corresponds to the standard
    deviation of the wavelet's Gaussian envelope. Note that the length of the
    wavelet must not exceed the length of your signal.

    n_jobs : int | None
        The number of jobs to run in parallel. If ``-1``, it is set
        to the number of CPU cores. Requires the `joblib` package.
        ``None`` (default) is a marker for 'unset' that will be interpreted
        as ``n_jobs=1`` (sequential execution) unless the call is performed under
        a `joblib:joblib.parallel_config` context manager that sets another
        value for ``n_jobs``.
    picks : str | array-like | slice | None
        Channels to include. Slices and lists of integers will be interpreted as
        channel indices. In lists, channel *type* strings (e.g., ``['meg',
        'eeg']``) will pick channels of those types, channel *name* strings (e.g.,
        ``['MEG0111', 'MEG2623']`` will pick the given channels. Can also be the
        string values "all" to pick all channels, or "data" to pick :term:`data
        channels`. None (default) will pick good data channels. Note that channels
        in ``info['bads']`` *will be included* if their names or indices are
        explicitly provided.

    average : bool, default True
        If ``False`` return an `EpochsTFR` containing separate TFRs for each
        epoch. If ``True`` return an `AverageTFR` containing the average of all
        TFRs across epochs.

        ### üí° Note
            Using ``average=True`` is functionally equivalent to using
            ``average=False`` followed by ``EpochsTFR.average()``, but is
            more memory efficient.

    ### üìñ Notes
    -----

    In spectrotemporal analysis (as with traditional fourier methods),
    the temporal and spectral resolution are interrelated: longer temporal windows
    allow more precise frequency estimates; shorter temporal windows "smear"
    frequency estimates while providing more precise timing information.

    Time-frequency representations are computed using a sliding temporal window.
    Either the temporal window has a fixed length independent of frequency, or the
    temporal window decreases in length with increased frequency.

    .. image:: https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/assets/img/tutorial/timefrequencyanalysis/figure1.png

    *Figure: Time and frequency smoothing. (a) For a fixed length temporal window
    the time and frequency smoothing remains fixed. (b) For temporal windows that
    decrease with frequency, the temporal smoothing decreases and the frequency
    smoothing increases with frequency.*
    Source: `FieldTrip tutorial: Time-frequency analysis using Hanning window,
    multitapers and wavelets <https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/tutorial/timefrequencyanalysis>`_.

    In MNE-Python, the multitaper temporal window length is defined by the arguments
    ``freqs`` and ``n_cycles``, respectively defining the frequencies of interest
    and the number of cycles: :math:`T = \\frac{\\mathtt{n\\_cycles}}{\\mathtt{freqs}}`

    A fixed number of cycles for all frequencies will yield a temporal window which
    decreases with frequency. For example, ``freqs=np.arange(1, 6, 2)`` and
    ``n_cycles=2`` yields ``T=array([2., 0.7, 0.4])``.

    To use a temporal window with fixed length, the number of cycles has to be
    defined based on the frequency. For example, ``freqs=np.arange(1, 6, 2)`` and
    ``n_cycles=freqs / 2`` yields ``T=array([0.5, 0.5, 0.5])``.

    In MNE-Python's multitaper functions, the frequency bandwidth is
    additionally affected by the parameter ``time_bandwidth``.
    The ``n_cycles`` parameter determines the temporal window length based on the
    frequencies of interest: :math:`T = \\frac{\\mathtt{n\\_cycles}}{\\mathtt{freqs}}`.
    The ``time_bandwidth`` parameter defines the "time-bandwidth product", which is
    the product of the temporal window length (in seconds) and the frequency
    bandwidth (in Hz). Thus once ``n_cycles`` has been set, frequency bandwidth is
    determined by :math:`\\frac{\\mathrm{time~bandwidth}}{\\mathrm{time~window}}`, and
    thus passing a larger ``time_bandwidth`` value will increase the frequency
    bandwidth (thereby decreasing the frequency *resolution*).

    The increased frequency bandwidth is reached by averaging spectral estimates
    obtained from multiple tapers. Thus, ``time_bandwidth`` also determines the
    number of tapers used. MNE-Python uses only "good" tapers (tapers with minimal
    leakage from far-away frequencies); the number of good tapers is
    ``floor(time_bandwidth - 1)``. This means there is another trade-off at play,
    between frequency resolution and the variance reduction that multitaper
    analysis provides. Striving for finer frequency resolution (by setting
    ``time_bandwidth`` low) means fewer tapers will be used, which undermines what
    is unique about multitaper methods ‚Äî namely their ability to improve accuracy /
    reduce noise in the power estimates by using several (orthogonal) tapers.

    ### ‚õîÔ∏è Warning

        In `mne.time_frequency.tfr_array_multitaper` and
        `mne.time_frequency.tfr_multitaper`, ``time_bandwidth`` defines the
        product of the temporal window length with the *full* frequency bandwidth
        For example, a full bandwidth of 4 Hz at a frequency of interest of 10 Hz
        will "smear" the frequency estimate between 8 Hz and 12 Hz.

        This is not the case for `mne.time_frequency.psd_array_multitaper` where
        the argument ``bandwidth`` defines the *half* frequency bandwidth. In the
        example above, the half-frequency bandwidth is 2 Hz.

            'auto', and ``combine`` is None, the title for each figure
            will be the channel name. If 'auto' and ``combine`` is not None,
            ``title`` states how many channels were combined into that figure
            and the method that was used for ``combine``. If str, that String
            will be the title for each figure.
        axes : instance of Axes | list | None
            The axes to plot to. If list, the list must be a list of Axes of
            the same length as ``picks``. If instance of Axes, there must be
            only one channel plotted. If ``combine`` is not None, ``axes``
            must either be an instance of Axes, or a list of length 1.
        layout : Layout | None
            Layout instance specifying sensor positions. Used for interactive
            plotting of topographies on rectangle selection. If possible, the
            correct layout is inferred from the data.
        yscale : 'auto' (default) | 'linear' | 'log'
            The scale of y (frequency) axis. 'linear' gives linear y axis,
            'log' leads to log-spaced y axis and 'auto' detects if frequencies
            are log-spaced and only then sets the y axis to 'log'.

            ‚ú® Added in vesion 0.14.0
        mask : ndarray | None
            An array of booleans of the same shape as the data. Entries of the
            data that correspond to False in the mask are plotted
            transparently. Useful for, e.g., masking for statistical
            significance.

            ‚ú® Added in vesion 0.16.0
        mask_style : None | 'both' | 'contour' | 'mask'
            If ``mask`` is not None: if ``'contour'``, a contour line is drawn
            around the masked areas (``True`` in ``mask``). If ``'mask'``,
            entries not ``True`` in ``mask`` are shown transparently. If
            ``'both'``, both a contour and transparency are used.
            If ``None``, defaults to ``'both'`` if ``mask`` is not None, and is
            ignored otherwise.

            ‚ú® Added in vesion 0.17
        mask_cmap : matplotlib colormap | (colormap, bool) | 'interactive'
            The colormap chosen for masked parts of the image (see below), if
            ``mask`` is not ``None``. If None, ``cmap`` is reused. Defaults to
            ``'Greys'``. Not interactive. Otherwise, as ``cmap``.

            ‚ú® Added in vesion 0.17
        mask_alpha : float
            A float between 0 and 1. If ``mask`` is not None, this sets the
            alpha level (degree of transparency) for the masked-out segments.
            I.e., if 0, masked-out segments are not visible at all.
            Defaults to 0.1.

            ‚ú® Added in vesion 0.16.0
        combine : 'mean' | 'rms' | callable | None
            Type of aggregation to perform across selected channels. If
            None, plot one figure per selected channel. If a function, it must
            operate on an array of shape ``(n_channels, n_freqs, n_times)`` and
            return an array of shape ``(n_freqs, n_times)``.

            üé≠ Changed in version 1.3
               Added support for ``callable``.
        exclude : list of str | 'bads'
            Channels names to exclude from being shown. If 'bads', the
            bad channels are excluded. Defaults to an empty list.

        cnorm : matplotlib.colors.Normalize | None
            How to normalize the colormap. If ``None``, standard linear normalization
            is performed. If not ``None``, ``vmin`` and ``vmax`` will be ignored.
            See `Matplotlib docs <matplotlib:colormapnorms>`
            for more details on colormap normalization, and
            `the ERDs example<cnorm-example>` for an example of its use.

            ‚ú® Added in vesion 0.24

        verbose : bool | str | int | None
            Control verbosity of the logging output. If ``None``, use the default
            verbosity level. See the `logging documentation <tut-logging>` and
            `mne.verbose` for details. Should only be passed as a keyword

        ### üõ†Ô∏è Parameters
        ----------
        timefreqs : None | list of tuple | dict of tuple
            The time-frequency point(s) for which topomaps will be plotted.
            See Notes.
        picks : str | array-like | slice | None
            Channels to include. Slices and lists of integers will be interpreted as
            channel indices. In lists, channel *type* strings (e.g., ``['meg',
            'eeg']``) will pick channels of those types, channel *name* strings (e.g.,
            ``['MEG0111', 'MEG2623']`` will pick the given channels. Can also be the
            string values "all" to pick all channels, or "data" to pick :term:`data
            channels`. None (default) will pick good data channels. Note that channels
            in ``info['bads']`` *will be included* if their names or indices are
            explicitly provided.
        baseline : None (default) or tuple of length 2
            The time interval to apply baseline correction.
            If None do not apply it. If baseline is (a, b)
            the interval is between "a (s)" and "b (s)".
            If a is None, the beginning of the data is used.
            If b is None, then b is set to the end of the interval.
            If baseline is equal to (None, None), the  entire time
            interval is used.
        mode : None | str
            If str, must be one of 'ratio', 'zscore', 'mean', 'percent',
            'logratio' and 'zlogratio'.
            Do baseline correction with ratio (power is divided by mean
            power during baseline) or zscore (power is divided by standard
            deviation of power during baseline after subtracting the mean,
            power = [power - mean(power_baseline)] / std(power_baseline)),
            mean simply subtracts the mean power, percent is the same as
            applying ratio then mean, logratio is the same as mean but then
            rendered in log-scale, zlogratio is the same as zscore but data
            is rendered in log-scale first.
            If None no baseline correction is applied.
        tmin, tmax : float | None
            First and last times to include, in seconds. ``None`` uses the first or
            last time present in the data. Default is ``tmin=None, tmax=None`` (all
            times).
        fmin, fmax : float
            The lower- and upper-bound on frequencies of interest. Default is ``fmin=0, fmax=np.inf`` (spans all frequencies present in the data).
        vmin : float | None
            The minimum value of the color scale for the image (for
            topomaps, see ``topomap_args``). If vmin is None, the data
            absolute minimum value is used.
        vmax : float | None
            The maximum value of the color scale for the image (for
            topomaps, see ``topomap_args``). If vmax is None, the data
            absolute maximum value is used.
        cmap : matplotlib colormap
            The colormap to use.
        dB : bool
            If True, 10*log10 is applied to the data to get dB.
        colorbar : bool
            If true, colorbar will be added to the plot (relating to the
            topomaps). For user defined axes, the colorbar cannot be drawn.
            Defaults to True.
        show : bool
            Call pyplot.show() at the end.
        title : str | None
            String for title. Defaults to None (blank/no title).
        yscale : 'auto' (default) | 'linear' | 'log'
            The scale of y (frequency) axis. 'linear' gives linear y axis,
            'log' leads to log-spaced y axis and 'auto' detects if frequencies
            are log-spaced and only then sets the y axis to 'log'.
        combine : 'mean' | 'rms' | callable
            Type of aggregation to perform across selected channels. If a
            function, it must operate on an array of shape
            ``(n_channels, n_freqs, n_times)`` and return an array of shape
            ``(n_freqs, n_times)``.

            üé≠ Changed in version 1.3
               Added support for ``callable``.
        exclude : list of str | 'bads'
            Channels names to exclude from being shown. If 'bads', the
            bad channels are excluded. Defaults to an empty list, i.e., ``[]``.
        topomap_args : None | dict
            A dict of ``kwargs`` that are forwarded to
            `mne.viz.plot_topomap` to style the topomaps. ``axes`` and
            ``show`` are ignored. If ``times`` is not in this dict, automatic
            peak detection is used. Beyond that, if ``None``, no customizable
            arguments will be passed.
            Defaults to ``None``.
        image_args : None | dict
            A dict of ``kwargs`` that are forwarded to `AverageTFR.plot`
            to style the image. ``axes`` and ``show`` are ignored. Beyond that,
            if ``None``, no customizable arguments will be passed.
            Defaults to ``None``.

        verbose : bool | str | int | None
            Control verbosity of the logging output. If ``None``, use the default
            verbosity level. See the `logging documentation <tut-logging>` and
            `mne.verbose` for details. Should only be passed as a keyword
            argument.

        ### ‚èé Returns
        -------
        fig : matplotlib.figure.Figure
            The figure containing the topography.

        ### üìñ Notes
        -----
        ``timefreqs`` has three different modes: tuples, dicts, and auto.
        For (list of) tuple(s) mode, each tuple defines a pair
        (time, frequency) in s and Hz on the TFR plot. For example, to
        look at 10 Hz activity 1 second into the epoch and 3 Hz activity
        300 msec into the epoch, ::

            timefreqs=((1, 10), (.3, 3))

        If provided as a dictionary, (time, frequency) tuples are keys and
        (time_window, frequency_window) tuples are the values - indicating the
        width of the windows (centered on the time and frequency indicated by
        the key) to be averaged over. For example, ::

            timefreqs={(1, 10): (0.1, 2)}

        would translate into a window that spans 0.95 to 1.05 seconds, as
        well as 9 to 11 Hz. If None, a single topomap will be plotted at the
        absolute peak across the time-frequency representation.

            Perform baseline correction by

              - subtracting the mean baseline power ('mean')
              - dividing by the mean baseline power ('ratio')
              - dividing by the mean baseline power and taking the log ('logratio')
              - subtracting the mean baseline power followed by dividing by the
                mean baseline power ('percent')
              - subtracting the mean baseline power and dividing by the standard
                deviation of the baseline power ('zscore')
              - dividing by the mean baseline power, taking the log, and dividing
                by the standard deviation of the baseline power ('zlogratio')

            If None no baseline correction is applied.

        sensors : bool | str
            Whether to add markers for sensor locations. If `str`, should be a
            valid matplotlib format string (e.g., ``'r+'`` for red plusses, see the
            Notes section of `matplotlib.axes.Axes.plot`). If ``True`` (the
            default), black circles will be used.

        show_names : bool | callable
            If ``True``, show channel names next to each sensor marker. If callable,
            channel names will be formatted using the callable; e.g., to
            delete the prefix 'MEG ' from all channel names, pass the function
            ``lambda x: x.replace('MEG ', '')``. If ``mask`` is not ``None``, only
            non-masked sensor names will be shown.

        mask : ndarray of bool, shape (n_channels, n_times) | None
            Array indicating channel-time combinations to highlight with a distinct
            plotting style (useful for, e.g. marking which channels at which times a statistical test of the data reaches significance). Array elements set to ``True`` will be plotted
            with the parameters given in ``mask_params``. Defaults to ``None``,
            equivalent to an array of all ``False`` elements.

        mask_params : dict | None
            Additional plotting parameters for plotting significant sensors.
            Default (None) equals::

                dict(marker='o', markerfacecolor='w', markeredgecolor='k',
                        linewidth=0, markersize=4)

        contours : int | array-like
            The number of contour lines to draw. If ``0``, no contours will be drawn.
            If a positive integer, that number of contour levels are chosen using the
            matplotlib tick locator (may sometimes be inaccurate, use array for
            accuracy). If array-like, the array values are used as the contour levels.
            The values should be in ¬µV for EEG, fT for magnetometers and fT/m for
            gradiometers. If ``colorbar=True``, the colorbar will have ticks
            corresponding to the contour levels. Default is ``6``.

        outlines : 'head' | dict | None
            The outlines to be drawn. If 'head', the default head scheme will be
            drawn. If dict, each key refers to a tuple of x and y positions, the values
            in 'mask_pos' will serve as image mask.
            Alternatively, a matplotlib patch object can be passed for advanced
            masking options, either directly or as a function that returns patches
            (required for multi-axis plots). If None, nothing will be drawn.
            Defaults to 'head'.
        sphere : float | array-like | instance of ConductorModel | None  | 'auto' | 'eeglab'
            The sphere parameters to use for the head outline. Can be array-like of
            shape (4,) to give the X/Y/Z origin and radius in meters, or a single float
            to give just the radius (origin assumed 0, 0, 0). Can also be an instance
            of a spherical `mne.bem.ConductorModel` to use the origin and
            radius from that object. If ``'auto'`` the sphere is fit to digitization
            points. If ``'eeglab'`` the head circle is defined by EEG electrodes
            ``'Fpz'``, ``'Oz'``, ``'T7'``, and ``'T8'`` (if ``'Fpz'`` is not present,
            it will be approximated from the coordinates of ``'Oz'``). ``None`` (the
            default) is equivalent to ``'auto'`` when enough extra digitization points
            are available, and (0, 0, 0, 0.095) otherwise.

            ‚ú® Added in vesion 0.20
            üé≠ Changed in version 1.1 Added ``'eeglab'`` option.

        image_interp : str
            The image interpolation to be used. Options are ``'cubic'`` (default)
            to use `scipy.interpolate.CloughTocher2DInterpolator`,
            ``'nearest'`` to use `scipy.spatial.Voronoi` or
            ``'linear'`` to use `scipy.interpolate.LinearNDInterpolator`.

        extrapolate : str
            Options:

            - ``'box'``
                Extrapolate to four points placed to form a square encompassing all
                data points, where each side of the square is three times the range
                of the data in the respective dimension.
            - ``'local'`` (default for MEG sensors)
                Extrapolate only to nearby points (approximately to points closer than
                median inter-electrode distance). This will also set the
                mask to be polygonal based on the convex hull of the sensors.
            - ``'head'`` (default for non-MEG sensors)
                Extrapolate out to the edges of the clipping circle. This will be on
                the head circle when the sensors are contained within the head circle,
                but it can extend beyond the head when sensors are plotted outside
                the head circle.

            üé≠ Changed in version 0.21

               - The default was changed to ``'local'`` for MEG sensors.
               - ``'local'`` was changed to use a convex hull mask
               - ``'head'`` was changed to extrapolate out to the clipping circle.

        border : float | 'mean'
            Value to extrapolate to on the topomap borders. If ``'mean'`` (default),
            then each extrapolated point has the average value of its neighbours.

            ‚ú® Added in vesion 0.20

        res : int
            The resolution of the topomap image (number of pixels along each side).

        size : float
            Side length of each subplot in inches.

        cmap : matplotlib colormap | (colormap, bool) | 'interactive' | None
            Colormap to use. If `tuple`, the first value indicates the colormap
            to use and the second value is a boolean defining interactivity. In
            interactive mode the colors are adjustable by clicking and dragging the
            colorbar with left and right mouse button. Left mouse button moves the
            scale up and down and right mouse button adjusts the range. Hitting
            space bar resets the range. Up and down arrows can be used to change
            the colormap. If ``None``, ``'Reds'`` is used for data that is either
            all-positive or all-negative, and ``'RdBu_r'`` is used otherwise.
            ``'interactive'`` is equivalent to ``(None, True)``. Defaults to ``None``.

            ### ‚õîÔ∏è Warning  Interactive mode works smoothly only for a small amount
                of topomaps. Interactive mode is disabled by default for more than
                2 topomaps.

        vlim : tuple of length 2
            Colormap limits to use. If a `tuple` of floats, specifies the
            lower and upper bounds of the colormap (in that order); providing
            ``None`` for either entry will set the corresponding boundary at the
            min/max of the data. Defaults to ``(None, None)``.

            ‚ú® Added in vesion 1.2

        cnorm : matplotlib.colors.Normalize | None
            How to normalize the colormap. If ``None``, standard linear normalization
            is performed. If not ``None``, ``vmin`` and ``vmax`` will be ignored.
            See `Matplotlib docs <matplotlib:colormapnorms>`
            for more details on colormap normalization, and
            `the ERDs example<cnorm-example>` for an example of its use.

            ‚ú® Added in vesion 1.2

        colorbar : bool
            Plot a colorbar in the rightmost column of the figure.
        cbar_fmt : str
            Formatting string for colorbar tick labels. See `formatspec` for
            details.

        units : str | None
            The units to use for the colorbar label. Ignored if ``colorbar=False``.
            If ``None`` the label will be "AU" indicating arbitrary units.
            Default is ``None``.
        axes : instance of Axes | None
            The axes to plot to. If ``None``, a new `matplotlib.figure.Figure`
            will be created. Default is ``None``.
        show : bool
            Show the figure if ``True``.

        ### ‚èé Returns

        -----
        Passing in ``np.median`` is considered unsafe when there is complex

        sorts the complex values by real part and return whatever value is

        complex case (i.e. the median of each component separately) if
        one passes in ``median``. See a discussion in scipy:
