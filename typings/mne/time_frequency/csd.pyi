    #### `bandwidth : float | None`
        The bandwidth of the multitaper windowing function in Hz.
    #### `adaptive : bool`
        Use adaptive weights to combine the tapered spectra into PSD.

        which means the projectors defined in the Epochs object will by copied.

        The number of jobs to run in parallel. If ``-1``, it is set
        to the number of CPU cores. Requires the `joblib` package.
        ``None`` (default) is a marker for 'unset' that will be interpreted
        as ``n_jobs=1`` (sequential execution) unless the call is performed under
        a `joblib:joblib.parallel_config` context manager that sets another
        value for ``n_jobs``.

    #### `verbose : bool | str | int | None`
        Control verbosity of the logging output. If ``None``, use the default
        verbosity level. See the `logging documentation <tut-logging>` and

    #### `max_iter : int`
        Maximum number of iterations to reach convergence when combining the
        tapered spectra with adaptive weights (see argument ``adaptive``). This
