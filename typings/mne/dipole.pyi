    """Dipole class for sequential dipole fits.

    ðŸ’¡ This class should usually not be instantiated directly via
        ``mne.Dipole(...)``. Instead, use one of the functions
        listed in the See Also section below.

    Used to store positions, orientations, amplitudes, times, goodness of fit
    of dipoles, typically obtained with Neuromag/xfit, mne_dipole_fit
    or certain inverse solvers. Note that dipole position vectors are given in
    the head coordinate frame.

    Parameters
    ----------
    times : array, shape (n_dipoles,)
        The time instants at which each dipole was fitted (s).
    pos : array, shape (n_dipoles, 3)
        The dipoles positions (m) in head coordinates.
    amplitude : array, shape (n_dipoles,)
        The amplitude of the dipoles (Am).
    ori : array, shape (n_dipoles, 3)
        The dipole orientations (normalized to unit length).
    gof : array, shape (n_dipoles,)
        The goodness of fit.
    name : str | None
        Name of the dipole.
    conf : dict
        Confidence limits in dipole orientation for "vol" in m^3 (volume),
        "depth" in m (along the depth axis), "long" in m (longitudinal axis),
        "trans" in m (transverse axis), "qlong" in Am, and "qtrans" in Am
        (currents). The current confidence limit in the depth direction is
        assumed to be zero (although it can be non-zero when a BEM is used).

        âœ¨ Added in version 0.15
    khi2 : array, shape (n_dipoles,)
        The Ï‡^2 values for the fits.

        âœ¨ Added in version 0.15
    nfree : array, shape (n_dipoles,)
        The number of free parameters for each fit.

        title : str | None
            The title of the figure if ``mode='orthoview'`` (ignored for all other

    Parameters
    ----------
    evoked : instance of Evoked
        The dataset to fit.
    cov : str | instance of Covariance
        The noise covariance.
    bem : path-like | instance of ConductorModel
        The BEM filename (str) or conductor model.
    trans : path-like | None
        The head<->MRI transform filename. Must be provided unless BEM
        is a sphere model.
    min_dist : float
        Minimum distance (in millimeters) from the dipole to the inner skull.
        Must be positive. Note that because this is a constraint passed to
        a solver it is not strict but close, i.e. for a ``min_dist=5.`` the
        fits could be 4.9 mm from the inner skull.
    n_jobs : int | None
        The number of jobs to run in parallel. If ``-1``, it is set
        to the number of CPU cores. Requires the `joblib` package.
        ``None`` (default) is a marker for 'unset' that will be interpreted
        as ``n_jobs=1`` (sequential execution) unless the call is performed under
        a `joblib:joblib.parallel_config` context manager that sets another
        value for ``n_jobs``.
        It is used in field computation and fitting.
    pos : ndarray, shape (3,) | None
        Position of the dipole to use. If None (default), sequential
        fitting (different position and orientation for each time instance)
        is performed. If a position (in head coords) is given as an array,
        the position is fixed during fitting.

        âœ¨ Added in version 0.12
    ori : ndarray, shape (3,) | None
        Orientation of the dipole to use. If None (default), the
        orientation is free to change as a function of time. If an
        orientation (in head coordinates) is given as an array, ``pos``
        must also be provided, and the routine computes the amplitude and
        goodness of fit of the dipole at the given position and orientation
        for each time instant.

        âœ¨ Added in version 0.12

    rank : None | 'info' | 'full' | dict
        This controls the rank computation that can be read from the
        measurement info or estimated from the data. When a noise covariance
        is used for whitening, this should reflect the rank of that covariance,
        otherwise amplification of noise components can occur in whitening (e.g.,
        often during source localization).

        :data:`python:None`
            The rank will be estimated from the data after proper scaling of
            different channel types.
        ``'info'``
            The rank is inferred from ``info``. If data have been processed
            with Maxwell filtering, the Maxwell filtering header is used.
            Otherwise, the channel counts themselves are used.
            In both cases, the number of projectors is subtracted from
            the (effective) number of channels in the data.
            For example, if Maxwell filtering reduces the rank to 68, with
            two projectors the returned value will be 66.
        ``'full'``
            The rank is assumed to be full, i.e. equal to the
            number of good channels. If a `Covariance` is passed, this can
            make sense if it has been (possibly improperly) regularized without
            taking into account the true data rank.
        `dict`
            Calculate the rank only for a subset of channel types, and explicitly
            specify the rank for the remaining channel types. This can be
            extremely useful if you already **know** the rank of (part of) your
            data, for instance in case you have calculated it earlier.

            This parameter must be a dictionary whose **keys** correspond to
            channel types in the data (e.g. ``'meg'``, ``'mag'``, ``'grad'``,
            ``'eeg'``), and whose **values** are integers representing the
            respective ranks. For example, ``{'mag': 90, 'eeg': 45}`` will assume
            a rank of ``90`` and ``45`` for magnetometer data and EEG data,
            respectively.

            The ranks for all channel types present in the data, but
            **not** specified in the dictionary will be estimated empirically.
            That is, if you passed a dataset containing magnetometer, gradiometer,
            and EEG data together with the dictionary from the previous example,
            only the gradiometer rank would be determined, while the specified
            magnetometer and EEG ranks would be taken for granted.

        The default is ``None``.

        âœ¨ Added in version 0.20
    accuracy : str
        Can be ``"normal"`` (default) or ``"accurate"``, which gives the most
        accurate coil definition but is typically not necessary for real-world
        data.

        âœ¨ Added in version 0.24
    tol : float
        Final accuracy of the optimization (see ``rhoend`` argument of
        `scipy.optimize.fmin_cobyla`).

    verbose : bool | str | int | None
        Control verbosity of the logging output. If ``None``, use the default
        verbosity level. See the `logging documentation <tut-logging>` and
        `mne.verbose` for details. Should only be passed as a keyword
        argument.

    -------
    dip : instance of Dipole or DipoleFixed
        The dipole fits. A `mne.DipoleFixed` is returned if
