    """Create a SourceMorph from one subject to another.

    Method is based on spherical morphing by FreeSurfer for surface
    cortical estimates `GreveEtAl2013` and
    Symmetric Diffeomorphic Registration for volumic data
    `AvantsEtAl2008`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    src : instance of SourceSpaces | instance of SourceEstimate
        The SourceSpaces of subject_from (can be a
        SourceEstimate if only using a surface source space).
    subject_from : str | None
        Name of the original subject as named in the SUBJECTS_DIR.
        If None (default), then ``src[0]['subject_his_id]'`` will be used.
    subject_to : str | None
        Name of the subject to which to morph as named in the SUBJECTS_DIR.
        Default is ``'fsaverage'``. If None, ``src_to[0]['subject_his_id']``
        will be used.

        ðŸŽ­ Changed in version 0.20
           Support for subject_to=None.

    subjects_dir : path-like | None
        The path to the directory containing the FreeSurfer subjects
        reconstructions. If ``None``, defaults to the ``SUBJECTS_DIR`` environment
        variable.
    zooms : float | tuple | str | None
        The voxel size of volume for each spatial dimension in mm.
        If spacing is None, MRIs won't be resliced, and both volumes
        must have the same number of spatial dimensions.
        Can also be ``'auto'`` to use ``5.`` if ``src_to is None`` and
        the zooms from ``src_to`` otherwise.

        ðŸŽ­ Changed in version 0.20
           Support for 'auto' mode.
    niter_affine : tuple of int
        Number of levels (``len(niter_affine)``) and number of
        iterations per level - for each successive stage of iterative
        refinement - to perform the affine transform.
        Default is niter_affine=(100, 100, 10).
    niter_sdr : tuple of int
        Number of levels (``len(niter_sdr)``) and number of
        iterations per level - for each successive stage of iterative
        refinement - to perform the Symmetric Diffeomorphic Registration (sdr)
        transform. Default is niter_sdr=(5, 5, 3).
    spacing : int | list | None
        The resolution of the icosahedral mesh (typically 5).
        If None, all vertices will be used (potentially filling the
        surface). If a list, then values will be morphed to the set of
        vertices specified in in ``spacing[0]`` and ``spacing[1]``.
        This will be ignored if ``src_to`` is supplied.

        ðŸŽ­ Changed in version 0.21
           src_to, if provided, takes precedence.
    smooth : int | str | None
        Number of iterations for the smoothing of the surface data.
        If None, smooth is automatically defined to fill the surface
        with non-zero values. Can also be ``'nearest'`` to use the nearest
        vertices on the surface.

        ðŸŽ­ Changed in version 0.20
           Added support for 'nearest'.
    warn : bool
        If True, warn if not all vertices were used. The default is warn=True.
    xhemi : bool
        Morph across hemisphere. Currently only implemented for
        ``subject_to == subject_from``. See notes below.
        The default is xhemi=False.
    sparse : bool
        Morph as a sparse source estimate. Works only with (Vector)
        SourceEstimate. If True the only parameters used are subject_to and
        subject_from, and spacing has to be None. Default is sparse=False.
    src_to : instance of SourceSpaces | None
        The destination source space.

        - For surface-based morphing, this is the preferred over ``spacing``
          for providing the vertices.
        - For volumetric morphing, this should be passed so that 1) the
          resultingmorph volume is properly constrained to the brain volume,
          and 2) STCs from multiple subjects morphed to the same destination
          subject/source space have the vertices.
        - For mixed (surface + volume) morphing, this is required.

        âœ¨ Added in version 0.20
    precompute : bool
        If True (default False), compute the sparse matrix representation of
        the volumetric morph (if present). This takes a long time to
        compute, but can make morphs faster when thousands of points are used.
        See `mne.SourceMorph.compute_vol_morph_mat` (which can be called
        later if desired) for more information.

        âœ¨ Added in version 0.22

    verbose : bool | str | int | None
        Control verbosity of the logging output. If ``None``, use the default
        verbosity level. See the `logging documentation <tut-logging>` and
        `mne.verbose` for details. Should only be passed as a keyword
        argument.

    Returns
    -------
    morph : instance of SourceMorph
        The `mne.SourceMorph` object.

    Notes
    -----
    This function can be used to morph surface data between hemispheres by
    setting ``xhemi=True``. The full cross-hemisphere morph matrix maps left
    to right and right to left. A matrix for cross-mapping only one hemisphere
    can be constructed by specifying the appropriate vertices, for example, to
    map the right hemisphere to the left::

        vertices_from=[[], vert_rh], vertices_to=[vert_lh, []]

    Cross-hemisphere mapping requires appropriate ``sphere.left_right``
    morph-maps in the subject's directory. These morph maps are included
    with the ``fsaverage_sym`` FreeSurfer subject, and can be created for other
    subjects with the ``mris_left_right_register`` FreeSurfer command. The
    ``fsaverage_sym`` subject is included with FreeSurfer > 5.1 and can be
    obtained as described `here
    <https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/Xhemi>`_. For statistical
    comparisons between hemispheres, use of the symmetric ``fsaverage_sym``
    model is recommended to minimize bias `GreveEtAl2013`.

    âœ¨ Added in version 0.17.0

    âœ¨ Added in version 0.21.0
       Support for morphing mixed source estimates.

        Notes
        -----
        For a volumetric morph, this will compute the morph for an identity
        source volume, i.e., with one source vertex active at a time, and store
        the result as a `sparse <scipy.sparse.csr_matrix>`
        morphing matrix. This takes a long time (minutes) to compute initially,
        but drastically speeds up `apply` for STCs, so it can be
        beneficial when many time points or many morphs (i.e., greater than
        the number of volumetric ``src_from`` vertices) will be performed.

        When calling `save`, this sparse morphing matrix is saved with
        the instance, so this only needs to be called once. This function does
        nothing if the morph matrix has already been computed, or if there is
        no volume morphing necessary.
