    Parameters
    ----------

    subject : str
        The FreeSurfer subject name.
    seeds : int | list
        Seed, or list of seeds. Each seed can be either a vertex number or
        a list of vertex numbers.

    n_jobs : int | None
        The number of jobs to run in parallel. If ``-1``, it is set
        to the number of CPU cores. Requires the :mod:`joblib` package.
        ``None`` (default) is a marker for 'unset' that will be interpreted
        as ``n_jobs=1`` (sequential execution) unless the call is performed under
        a :class:`joblib:joblib.parallel_config` context manager that sets another
        value for ``n_jobs``.
        Likely only useful if tens or hundreds of labels are being expanded
        simultaneously. Does not apply with ``overlap=False``.
    overlap : bool
        Produce overlapping labels. If True (default), the resulting labels
        can be overlapping. If False, each label will be grown one step at a
        time, and occupied territory will not be invaded.
    names : None | list of str
        Assign names to the new labels (list needs to have the same length as
        seeds).
    surface : str
        The surface along which to do the computations, defaults to ``'white'``
        (the gray-white matter boundary).
    colors : array, shape (n, 4) or (, 4) | None
        How to assign colors to each label. If None then unique colors will be
        chosen automatically (default), otherwise colors will be broadcast
        from the array. The first three values will be interpreted as RGB
        colors and the fourth column as the alpha value (commonly 1).

    Returns
    -------
    labels : list of Label
        The labels' ``comment`` attribute contains information on the seed
        vertex and extent; the ``values``  attribute contains distance from the
        seed in millimeters.

    Notes
    -----
    "extents" and "hemis" can either be arrays with the same length as
