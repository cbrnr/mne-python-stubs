    ### üõ†Ô∏è Parameters

    info_fname : None | str
        Name of the file containing the info dictionary.

    subjects_dir : path-like | None
        The path to the directory containing the FreeSurfer subjects
        reconstructions. If ``None``, defaults to the ``SUBJECTS_DIR`` environment
        variable.
    subject : str | None
        Subject name.
    title : str
        Title of the report.
    cov_fname : None | str
        Name of the file containing the noise covariance.

    baseline : None | tuple of length 2
        The time interval to consider as "baseline" when applying baseline
        correction. If ``None``, do not apply baseline correction.
        If a tuple ``(a, b)``, the interval is between ``a`` and ``b``
        (in seconds), including the endpoints.
        If ``a`` is ``None``, the **beginning** of the data is used; and if ``b``
        is ``None``, it is set to the **end** of the interval.
        If ``(None, None)``, the entire time interval is used.

        ### üí° Note The baseline ``(a, b)`` includes both endpoints, i.e. all
                    timepoints ``t`` such that ``a <= t <= b``.

        Correction is applied in the following way **to each channel:**

        1. Calculate the mean signal of the baseline period.
        2. Subtract this mean from the **entire** time period.

        For `mne.Epochs`, this algorithm is run **on each epoch individually.**
        Defaults to ``None``, i.e. no baseline correction.
    image_format : 'png' | 'svg' | 'webp' | 'auto'
        Default image format to use (default is ``'auto'``, which will use
        ``'webp'`` if available and ``'png'`` otherwise).
        ``'svg'`` uses vector graphics, so fidelity is higher but can increase
        file size and browser image rendering time as well.
        ``'webp'`` format requires matplotlib >= 3.6.

        ‚ú® Added in vesion 0.15
        üé≠ Changed in version 1.3
           Added support for ``'webp'`` format, removed support for GIF, and
           set the default to ``'auto'``.
    raw_psd : bool | dict
        If True, include PSD plots for raw files. Can be False (default) to
        omit, True to plot, or a dict to pass as ``kwargs`` to
        `mne.time_frequency.Spectrum.plot`.

        ‚ú® Added in vesion 0.17
        üé≠ Changed in version 1.4
           kwargs are sent to ``spectrum.plot`` instead of ``raw.plot_psd``.
    projs : bool
        Whether to include topographic plots of SSP projectors, if present in
        the data. Defaults to ``False``.

        ‚ú® Added in vesion 0.21

    verbose : bool | str | int | None
        Control verbosity of the logging output. If ``None``, use the default
        verbosity level. See the `logging documentation <tut-logging>` and
        `mne.verbose` for details. Should only be passed as a keyword
        argument.

    ### üìä Attributes

    info_fname : None | str
        Name of the file containing the info dictionary.

    subjects_dir : path-like | None
        The path to the directory containing the FreeSurfer subjects
        reconstructions. If ``None``, defaults to the ``SUBJECTS_DIR`` environment
        variable.
    subject : str | None
        Subject name.
    title : str
        Title of the report.
    cov_fname : None | str

    baseline : None | tuple of length 2
        The time interval to consider as "baseline" when applying baseline
        correction. If ``None``, do not apply baseline correction.
        If a tuple ``(a, b)``, the interval is between ``a`` and ``b``
        (in seconds), including the endpoints.
        If ``a`` is ``None``, the **beginning** of the data is used; and if ``b``
        is ``None``, it is set to the **end** of the interval.
        If ``(None, None)``, the entire time interval is used.

        ### üí° Note The baseline ``(a, b)`` includes both endpoints, i.e. all
                    timepoints ``t`` such that ``a <= t <= b``.

        Correction is applied in the following way **to each channel:**

        butterfly : bool | int
            Whether to add butterfly plots of the data. Can be useful to
            spot problematic channels. If ``True``, 10 equally-spaced 1-second
            segments will be plotted. If an integer, specifies the number of

                signal range around zero (i.e. from ``0`` to ``+s`` or from ``0`` to
                ``-s``). For example, the default scaling of ``20e-6`` (20¬µV) for EEG
                signals means that the visualized range will be 40 ¬µV (20 ¬µV in the

            ``None`` (default) is a marker for 'unset' that will be interpreted

        section : str | None
            The name of the section (or content block) to add the content to. This
            feature is useful for grouping multiple related content elements
            together under a single, collapsible section. Each content element will
            retain its own title and functionality, but not appear separately in the
            table of contents. Hence, using sections is a way to declutter the table
            of contents, and to easy navigation of the report.

        open_browser : bool
