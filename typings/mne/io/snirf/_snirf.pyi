):
    """Reader for a continuous wave SNIRF data.

    ðŸ’¡ Note This reader supports the .snirf file type only,
              not the .jnirs version.
              Files with either 3D or 2D locations can be read.
              However, we strongly recommend using 3D positions.
              If 2D positions are used the behaviour of MNE functions
              can not be guaranteed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fname : path-like
        Path to the SNIRF data file.
    optode_frame : str
        Coordinate frame used for the optode positions. The default is unknown,
        in which case the positions are not modified. If a known coordinate
        frame is provided (head, meg, mri), then the positions are transformed
        in to the Neuromag head coordinate frame (head).

    preload : bool or str (default False)
        Preload data into memory for data manipulation and faster indexing.
        If True, the data will be preloaded into memory (fast, requires
        large amount of memory). If preload is a string, preload is the
        file name of a memory-mapped file which is used to store the data
        on the hard drive (slower, requires less memory).

    verbose : bool | str | int | None
        Control verbosity of the logging output. If ``None``, use the default
        verbosity level. See the `logging documentation <tut-logging>` and
        `mne.verbose` for details. Should only be passed as a keyword
        argument.

    Returns
    -------
    raw : instance of RawSNIRF
        A Raw object containing fNIRS data.
        See `mne.io.Raw` for documentation of attributes and methods.
