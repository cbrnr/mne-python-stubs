    ### üõ†Ô∏è Parameters

    #### `fname : path-like`
        Name of evoked/average FIF file to load.
        If None no data is loaded.
    #### `condition : int, or str`
        Dataset ID number (int) or comment/name (str). Optional if there is
        only one data set in file.
    #### `proj : bool, optional`
        Apply SSP projection vectors.
    #### `kind : str`
        Either ``'average'`` or ``'standard_error'``. The type of data to read.
        Only used if 'condition' is a str.
    #### `allow_maxshield : bool | str (default False)`
        If True, allow loading of data that has been recorded with internal
        active compensation (MaxShield). Data recorded with MaxShield should
        generally not be loaded directly, but should first be processed using
        SSS/tSSS to remove the compensation signals that may also affect brain
        activity. Can also be ``"yes"`` to load without eliciting a warning.

    #### `verbose : bool | str | int | None`
        Control verbosity of the logging output. If ``None``, use the default
        verbosity level. See the `logging documentation <tut-logging>` and
        `mne.verbose` for details. Should only be passed as a keyword
        argument.

    -----
    ### üìä Attributes


    #### `info : mne.Info`
        The `mne.Info` object with information about the sensors and methods of measurement.
    #### `ch_names : list of str`
        List of channels' names.
    #### `nave : int`
        Number of averaged epochs.
    #### `kind : str`
        Type of data, either average or standard_error.
    #### `comment : str`
        Comment on dataset. Can be the condition.
    #### `data : array of shape (n_channels, n_times)`
        Evoked response.
    #### `first : int`
        First time sample.
    #### `last : int`
        Last time sample.
    #### `tmin : float`
        The first time point in seconds.
    #### `tmax : float`
        The last time point in seconds.
    #### `times :  array`
        Time vector in seconds. Goes from ``tmin`` to ``tmax``. Time interval
        between consecutive time samples is equal to the inverse of the
        sampling frequency.
    #### `baseline : None | tuple of length 2`
         This attribute reflects whether the data has been baseline-corrected
         (it will be a ``tuple`` then) or not (it will be ``None``).

        ### üõ†Ô∏è Parameters

        #### `picks : str | array-like | slice | None`
            Channels to include. Slices and lists of integers will be interpreted as
            channel indices. In lists, channel `type` strings (e.g., ``['meg',
            'eeg']``) will pick channels of those types, channel `name` strings (e.g.,
            ``['MEG0111', 'MEG2623']`` will pick the given channels. Can also be the
            string values "all" to pick all channels, or "data" to pick :term:`data
            channels`. None (default) will pick all channels. Note that channels in
            ``info['bads']`` `will be included` if their names or indices are
            explicitly provided.

        #### `units : str | dict | None`
            Specify the unit(s) that the data should be returned in. If
            ``None`` (default), the data is returned in the
            channel-type-specific default units, which are SI units (see
            `units` and :term:`data channels`). If a string, must be a
            sub-multiple of SI units that will be used to scale the data from
            all channels of the type associated with that unit. This only works
            if the data contains one channel type that has a unit (unitless
            channel types are left unchanged). For example if there are only
            EEG and STIM channels, ``units='uV'`` will scale EEG channels to
            micro-Volts while STIM channels will be unchanged. Finally, if a
            dictionary is provided, keys must be channel types, and values must
            be units to scale the data of that channel type to. For example
            ``dict(grad='fT/cm', mag='fT')`` will scale the corresponding types
            accordingly, but all other channel types will remain in their
            channel-type-specific default unit.
        #### `tmin : float | None`
            Start time of data to get in seconds.
        #### `tmax : float | None`
            End time of data to get in seconds.

        The function ``fun`` is applied to the channels defined in ``picks``.
        The evoked object's data is modified in-place. If the function returns a different
        data type (e.g. :py:obj:`numpy.complex128`) it must be specified
        using the ``dtype`` parameter, which causes the data type of `all` the data
        to change (even if the function is only applied to channels in ``picks``).

        ### üí° Note If ``n_jobs`` > 1, more memory is required as

        #### `fun : callable`
            A function to be applied to the channels. The first argument of
            fun has to be a timeseries (`numpy.ndarray`). The function must
            operate on an array of shape ``(n_times,)``  because it will apply channel-wise.
            The function must return an `numpy.ndarray` shaped like its input.
        #### `picks : str | array-like | slice | None`
            Channels to include. Slices and lists of integers will be interpreted as
            channel indices. In lists, channel `type` strings (e.g., ``['meg',
            'eeg']``) will pick channels of those types, channel `name` strings (e.g.,

            string values "all" to pick all channels, or "data" to pick :term:`data
            channels`. None (default) will pick all data channels (excluding reference
            MEG channels). Note that channels in ``info['bads']`` `will be included` if
            their names or indices are explicitly provided.

        #### `dtype : numpy.dtype`
            Data type to use after applying the function. If None
            (default) the data type is not modified.
        #### `n_jobs : int | None`
            The number of jobs to run in parallel. If ``-1``, it is set
            to the number of CPU cores. Requires the `joblib` package.
            ``None`` (default) is a marker for 'unset' that will be interpreted
            as ``n_jobs=1`` (sequential execution) unless the call is performed under
            a `joblib:joblib.parallel_config` context manager that sets another
            value for ``n_jobs``. Ignored if ``channel_wise=False`` as the workload
            is split across channels.

        #### `verbose : bool | str | int | None`
            Control verbosity of the logging output. If ``None``, use the default
            verbosity level. See the `logging documentation <tut-logging>` and

        #### `baseline : None | tuple of length 2`
            The time interval to consider as "baseline" when applying baseline
            correction. If ``None``, do not apply baseline correction.
            If a tuple ``(a, b)``, the interval is between ``a`` and ``b``

            If ``a`` is ``None``, the `beginning` of the data is used; and if ``b``
            is ``None``, it is set to the `end` of the interval.
            If ``(None, None)``, the entire time interval is used.

            ### üí° Note The baseline ``(a, b)`` includes both endpoints, i.e. all
                        timepoints ``t`` such that ``a <= t <= b``.

            Correction is applied `to each channel individually` in the following
            way:

            1. Calculate the mean signal of the baseline period.
            2. Subtract this mean from the `entire` ``Evoked``.

            Defaults to ``(None, 0)``, i.e. beginning of the the data until
            time point zero.

        #### `picks : str | array-like | slice | None`
            Channels to include. Slices and lists of integers will be interpreted as
            channel indices. In lists, channel `type` strings (e.g., ``['meg',
            'eeg']``) will pick channels of those types, channel `name` strings (e.g.,
            ``['MEG0111', 'MEG2623']`` will pick the given channels. Can also be the
            string values "all" to pick all channels, or "data" to pick :term:`data

            ``info['bads']`` `will be included` if their names or indices are
            explicitly provided.
        #### `exclude : list of str | 'bads'`
            Channels names to exclude from being shown. If 'bads', the
            bad channels are excluded.
        #### `unit : bool`
            Scale plot with channel (SI) unit.
        #### `show : bool`
            Show figure if True.
        #### `ylim : dict | None`
            Y limits for plots (after scaling has been applied). e.g.
            ylim = dict(eeg=[-20, 20])
            Valid keys are eeg, mag, grad, misc. If None, the ylim parameter
            for each channel equals the pyplot default.
        #### `xlim : 'tight' | tuple | None`
            X limits for plots.

        #### `proj : bool | 'interactive' | 'reconstruct'`
            If true SSP projections are applied before display. If 'interactive',
            a check box for reversible selection of SSP projection vectors will
            be shown. If 'reconstruct', projection vectors will be applied and then
            M/EEG data will be reconstructed via field mapping to reduce the signal
            bias caused by projection.

            üé≠ Changed in version 0.21
               Support for 'reconstruct' was added.
        #### `hline : list of float | None`
            The values at which to show an horizontal line.
        #### `units : dict | None`
            The units of the channel types used for axes labels. If None,
            defaults to ``dict(eeg='¬µV', grad='fT/cm', mag='fT')``.
        #### `scalings : dict | None`
            The scalings of the channel types to be applied for plotting. If None,
            defaults to ``dict(eeg=1e6, grad=1e13, mag=1e15)``.
        #### `titles : dict | None`
            The titles associated with the channels. If None, defaults to
            ``dict(eeg='EEG', grad='Gradiometers', mag='Magnetometers')``.
        #### `axes : instance of Axes | list | None`
            The axes to plot to. If list, the list must be a list of Axes of
            the same length as the number of channel types. If instance of
            Axes, there must be only one channel type plotted.
        #### `gfp : bool | 'only'`
            Plot the global field power (GFP) or the root mean square (RMS) of the
            data. For MEG data, this will plot the RMS. For EEG, it plots GFP,
            i.e. the standard deviation of the signal across channels. The GFP is
            equivalent to the RMS of an average-referenced signal.

            - ``True``
                Plot GFP or RMS (for EEG and MEG, respectively) and traces for all
                channels.
            - ``'only'``
                Plot GFP or RMS (for EEG and MEG, respectively), and omit the
                traces for individual channels.

            The color of the GFP/RMS trace will be green if
            ``spatial_colors=False``, and black otherwise.

            üé≠ Changed in version 0.23
               Plot GFP for EEG instead of RMS. Label RMS traces correctly as such.
        #### `window_title : str | None`
            The title to put at the top of the figure.
        #### `spatial_colors : bool | 'auto'`
            If True, the lines are color coded by mapping physical sensor
            coordinates into color values. Spatially similar channels will have
            similar colors. Bad channels will be dotted. If False, the good
            channels are plotted black and bad channels red. If ``'auto'``, uses
            True if channel locations are present, and False if channel locations
            are missing or if the data contains only a single channel. Defaults to
            ``'auto'``.
        #### `zorder : str | callable`
            Which channels to put in the front or back. Only matters if
            ``spatial_colors`` is used.
            If str, must be ``std`` or ``unsorted`` (defaults to ``unsorted``). If
            ``std``, data with the lowest standard deviation (weakest effects) will
            be put in front so that they are not obscured by those with stronger
            effects. If ``unsorted``, channels are z-sorted as in the evoked
            instance.
            If callable, must take one argument: a numpy array of the same
            dimensionality as the evoked raw data; and return a list of
            unique integers corresponding to the number of channels.

            ‚ú® Added in vesion 0.13.0

        #### `selectable : bool`
            Whether to use interactive features. If True (default), it is possible
            to paint an area to draw topomaps. When False, the interactive features
            are disabled. Disabling interactive features reduces memory consumption
            and is useful when using ``axes`` parameter to draw multiaxes figures.

            ‚ú® Added in vesion 0.13.0

        #### `noise_cov : instance of Covariance | str | None`
            Noise covariance used to whiten the data while plotting.
            Whitened data channel names are shown in italic.
            Can be a string to load a covariance from disk.
            See also `mne.Evoked.plot_white` for additional inspection
            of noise covariance properties when whitening evoked data.
            For data processed with SSS, the effective dependence between
            magnetometers and gradiometers may introduce differences in scaling,
            consider using `mne.Evoked.plot_white`.

            ‚ú® Added in vesion 0.16.0
        #### `time_unit : str`
            The units for the time axis, can be "s" (default) or "ms".

            ‚ú® Added in vesion 0.16
        #### `sphere : float | array-like | instance of ConductorModel | None  | 'auto' | 'eeglab'`
            The sphere parameters to use for the head outline. Can be array-like of
            shape (4,) to give the X/Y/Z origin and radius in meters, or a single float
            to give just the radius (origin assumed 0, 0, 0). Can also be an instance
            of a spherical `mne.bem.ConductorModel` to use the origin and
            radius from that object. If ``'auto'`` the sphere is fit to digitization
            points. If ``'eeglab'`` the head circle is defined by EEG electrodes
            ``'Fpz'``, ``'Oz'``, ``'T7'``, and ``'T8'`` (if ``'Fpz'`` is not present,
            it will be approximated from the coordinates of ``'Oz'``). ``None`` (the
            default) is equivalent to ``'auto'`` when enough extra digitization points
            are available, and (0, 0, 0, 0.095) otherwise.

            ‚ú® Added in vesion 0.20
            üé≠ Changed in version 1.1 Added ``'eeglab'`` option.
        #### `highlight : array-like of float, shape(2,) | array-like of float, shape (n, 2) | None`
            Segments of the data to highlight by means of a light-yellow
            background color. Can be used to put visual emphasis on certain
            time periods. The time periods must be specified as ``array-like``
            objects in the form of ``(t_start, t_end)`` in the unit given by the
            ``time_unit`` parameter.
            Multiple time periods can be specified by passing an ``array-like``
            object of individual time periods (e.g., for 3 time periods, the shape
            of the passed object would be ``(3, 2)``. If ``None``, no highlighting
            is applied.

            ‚ú® Added in vesion 1.1

        #### `verbose : bool | str | int | None`
            Control verbosity of the logging output. If ``None``, use the default
            verbosity level. See the `logging documentation <tut-logging>` and
            `mne.verbose` for details. Should only be passed as a keyword
            argument.

        ### üõ†Ô∏è Parameters

        #### `picks : str | array-like | slice | None`
            Channels to include. Slices and lists of integers will be interpreted as
            channel indices. In lists, channel `type` strings (e.g., ``['meg',
            'eeg']``) will pick channels of those types, channel `name` strings (e.g.,
            ``['MEG0111', 'MEG2623']`` will pick the given channels. Can also be the
            string values "all" to pick all channels, or "data" to pick :term:`data
            channels`. None (default) will pick all channels. Note that channels in
            ``info['bads']`` `will be included` if their names or indices are
            explicitly provided.
            This parameter can also be used to set the order the channels
            are shown in, as the channel image is sorted by the order of picks.
        #### `exclude : list of str | 'bads'`
            Channels names to exclude from being shown. If 'bads', the
            bad channels are excluded.
        #### `unit : bool`
            Scale plot with channel (SI) unit.
        #### `show : bool`
            Show figure if True.
        #### `clim : dict | None`
            Color limits for plots (after scaling has been applied). e.g.
            ``clim = dict(eeg=[-20, 20])``.
            Valid keys are eeg, mag, grad, misc. If None, the clim parameter
            for each channel equals the pyplot default.
        #### `xlim : 'tight' | tuple | None`
            X limits for plots.
        #### `proj : bool | 'interactive'`
            If true SSP projections are applied before display. If 'interactive',
            a check box for reversible selection of SSP projection vectors will
            be shown.
        #### `units : dict | None`
            The units of the channel types used for axes labels. If None,
            defaults to ``dict(eeg='¬µV', grad='fT/cm', mag='fT')``.
        #### `scalings : dict | None`
            The scalings of the channel types to be applied for plotting. If None,`
            defaults to ``dict(eeg=1e6, grad=1e13, mag=1e15)``.
        #### `titles : dict | None`
            The titles associated with the channels. If None, defaults to
            ``dict(eeg='EEG', grad='Gradiometers', mag='Magnetometers')``.
        #### `axes : instance of Axes | list | dict | None`
            The axes to plot to. If list, the list must be a list of Axes of
            the same length as the number of channel types. If instance of
            Axes, there must be only one channel type plotted.
            If ``group_by`` is a dict, this cannot be a list, but it can be a dict
            of lists of axes, with the keys matching those of ``group_by``. In that
            case, the provided axes will be used for the corresponding groups.
            Defaults to ``None``.
        #### `cmap : matplotlib colormap | (colormap, bool) | 'interactive'`
            Colormap. If tuple, the first value indicates the colormap to use and
            the second value is a boolean defining interactivity. In interactive
            mode the colors are adjustable by clicking and dragging the colorbar
            with left and right mouse button. Left mouse button moves the scale up
            and down and right mouse button adjusts the range. Hitting space bar
            resets the scale. Up and down arrows can be used to change the
            colormap. If 'interactive', translates to ``('RdBu_r', True)``.
            Defaults to ``'RdBu_r'``.
        #### `colorbar : bool`
            If True, plot a colorbar. Defaults to True.

            ‚ú® Added in vesion 0.16
        #### `mask : ndarray | None`
            An array of booleans of the same shape as the data. Entries of the
            data that correspond to ``False`` in the mask are masked (see
            ``do_mask`` below). Useful for, e.g., masking for statistical
            significance.

            ‚ú® Added in vesion 0.16
        #### `mask_style : None | 'both' | 'contour' | 'mask'`
            If ``mask`` is not None: if 'contour', a contour line is drawn around
            the masked areas (``True`` in ``mask``). If 'mask', entries not
            ``True`` in ``mask`` are shown transparently. If 'both', both a contour
            and transparency are used.
            If ``None``, defaults to 'both' if ``mask`` is not None, and is ignored
            otherwise.

             ‚ú® Added in vesion 0.16
        #### `mask_cmap : matplotlib colormap | (colormap, bool) | 'interactive'`
            The colormap chosen for masked parts of the image (see below), if
            ``mask`` is not ``None``. If None, ``cmap`` is reused. Defaults to
            ``Greys``. Not interactive. Otherwise, as ``cmap``.
        #### `mask_alpha : float`
            A float between 0 and 1. If ``mask`` is not None, this sets the
            alpha level (degree of transparency) for the masked-out segments.
            I.e., if 0, masked-out segments are not visible at all.
            Defaults to .25.

            ‚ú® Added in vesion 0.16
        #### `time_unit : str`
            The units for the time axis, can be "ms" or "s" (default).

            ‚ú® Added in vesion 0.16
        #### `show_names : bool | 'auto' | 'all'`
            Determines if channel names should be plotted on the y axis. If False,
            no names are shown. If True, ticks are set automatically by matplotlib
            and the corresponding channel names are shown. If "all", all channel
            names are shown. If "auto", is set to False if ``picks`` is ``None``,
            to ``True`` if ``picks`` contains 25 or more entries, or to "all"
            if ``picks`` contains fewer than 25 entries.
        #### `group_by : None | dict`
            If a dict, the values must be picks, and ``axes`` must also be a dict
            with matching keys, or None. If ``axes`` is None, one figure and one
            axis will be created for each entry in ``group_by``.Then, for each
            entry, the picked channels will be plotted to the corresponding axis.
            If ``titles`` are None, keys will become plot titles. This is useful
            for e.g. ROIs. Each entry must contain only one channel type.
            For example::

                group_by=dict(Left_ROI=[1, 2, 3, 4], Right_ROI=[5, 6, 7, 8])

            If None, all picked channels are plotted to the same axis.
        #### `sphere : float | array-like | instance of ConductorModel | None  | 'auto' | 'eeglab'`
            The sphere parameters to use for the head outline. Can be array-like of
            shape (4,) to give the X/Y/Z origin and radius in meters, or a single float
            to give just the radius (origin assumed 0, 0, 0). Can also be an instance
            of a spherical `mne.bem.ConductorModel` to use the origin and
            radius from that object. If ``'auto'`` the sphere is fit to digitization
            points. If ``'eeglab'`` the head circle is defined by EEG electrodes
            ``'Fpz'``, ``'Oz'``, ``'T7'``, and ``'T8'`` (if ``'Fpz'`` is not present,
            it will be approximated from the coordinates of ``'Oz'``). ``None`` (the
            default) is equivalent to ``'auto'`` when enough extra digitization points
            are available, and (0, 0, 0, 0.095) otherwise.

            data. Defaults to False.
        #### `legend : bool | int | str | tuple`
            If True, create a legend based on evoked.comment. If False, disable the
            legend. Otherwise, the legend is created and the parameter value is
            passed as the location parameter to the matplotlib legend call. It can
            be an integer (e.g. 0 corresponds to upper right corner of the plot),
            a string (e.g. 'upper right'), or a tuple (x, y coordinates of the

        -----
        ### üõ†Ô∏è Parameters

        #### `times : float | array of float | "auto" | "peaks" | "interactive"`
            The time point(s) to plot. If "auto", the number of ``axes`` determines
            the amount of time point(s). If ``axes`` is also None, at most 10
            topographies will be shown with a regular time spacing between the
            first and last time instant. If "peaks", finds time points
            automatically by checking for local maxima in global field power. If
            "interactive", the time can be set interactively at run-time by using a
            slider.

        #### `average : float | array-like of float, shape (n_times,) | None`
            The time window (in seconds) around a given time point to be used for
            averaging. For example, 0.2 would translate into a time window that
            starts 0.1 s before and ends 0.1 s after the given time point. If the
            time window exceeds the duration of the data, it will be clipped.
            Different time windows (one per time point) can be provided by
            passing an ``array-like`` object (e.g., ``[0.1, 0.2, 0.3]``). If
            ``None`` (default), no averaging will take place.

            üé≠ Changed in version 1.1
               Support for ``array-like`` input.
        #### `ch_type : 'mag' | 'grad' | 'planar1' | 'planar2' | 'eeg' | None`
            The channel type to plot. For ``'grad'``, the gradiometers are
            collected in pairs and the RMS for each pair is plotted. If
            ``None`` the first available channel type from order shown above is used. Defaults to ``None``.

        #### `scalings : dict | float | None`
            The scalings of the channel types to be applied for plotting.
            If None, defaults to ``dict(eeg=1e6, grad=1e13, mag=1e15)``.

        #### `proj : bool | 'interactive' | 'reconstruct'`
            If true SSP projections are applied before display. If 'interactive',
            a check box for reversible selection of SSP projection vectors will
            be shown. If 'reconstruct', projection vectors will be applied and then
            M/EEG data will be reconstructed via field mapping to reduce the signal
            bias caused by projection.

            üé≠ Changed in version 0.21
               Support for 'reconstruct' was added.

        #### `sensors : bool | str`
            Whether to add markers for sensor locations. If `str`, should be a
            valid matplotlib format string (e.g., ``'r+'`` for red plusses, see the
            Notes section of `matplotlib.axes.Axes.plot`). If ``True`` (the
            default), black circles will be used.

        #### `show_names : bool | callable`
            If ``True``, show channel names next to each sensor marker. If callable,
            channel names will be formatted using the callable; e.g., to
            delete the prefix 'MEG ' from all channel names, pass the function
            ``lambda x: x.replace('MEG ', '')``. If ``mask`` is not ``None``, only
            non-masked sensor names will be shown.

        #### `mask : ndarray of bool, shape (n_channels, n_times) | None`
            Array indicating channel-time combinations to highlight with a distinct
            plotting style (useful for, e.g. marking which channels at which times a statistical test of the data reaches significance). Array elements set to ``True`` will be plotted
            with the parameters given in ``mask_params``. Defaults to ``None``,
            equivalent to an array of all ``False`` elements.

        #### `mask_params : dict | None`
            Additional plotting parameters for plotting significant sensors.
            Default (None) equals::

                dict(marker='o', markerfacecolor='w', markeredgecolor='k',
                        linewidth=0, markersize=4)

        #### `contours : int | array-like`
            The number of contour lines to draw. If ``0``, no contours will be drawn.
            If a positive integer, that number of contour levels are chosen using the
            matplotlib tick locator (may sometimes be inaccurate, use array for
            accuracy). If array-like, the array values are used as the contour levels.
            The values should be in ¬µV for EEG, fT for magnetometers and fT/m for
            gradiometers. If ``colorbar=True``, the colorbar will have ticks
            corresponding to the contour levels. Default is ``6``.

        #### `outlines : 'head' | dict | None`
            The outlines to be drawn. If 'head', the default head scheme will be
            drawn. If dict, each key refers to a tuple of x and y positions, the values
            in 'mask_pos' will serve as image mask.
            Alternatively, a matplotlib patch object can be passed for advanced
            masking options, either directly or as a function that returns patches
            (required for multi-axis plots). If None, nothing will be drawn.
            Defaults to 'head'.
        #### `sphere : float | array-like | instance of ConductorModel | None  | 'auto' | 'eeglab'`
            The sphere parameters to use for the head outline. Can be array-like of
            shape (4,) to give the X/Y/Z origin and radius in meters, or a single float
            to give just the radius (origin assumed 0, 0, 0). Can also be an instance
            of a spherical `mne.bem.ConductorModel` to use the origin and
            radius from that object. If ``'auto'`` the sphere is fit to digitization
            points. If ``'eeglab'`` the head circle is defined by EEG electrodes
            ``'Fpz'``, ``'Oz'``, ``'T7'``, and ``'T8'`` (if ``'Fpz'`` is not present,
            it will be approximated from the coordinates of ``'Oz'``). ``None`` (the
            default) is equivalent to ``'auto'`` when enough extra digitization points
            are available, and (0, 0, 0, 0.095) otherwise.

            ‚ú® Added in vesion 0.20
            üé≠ Changed in version 1.1 Added ``'eeglab'`` option.

        #### `image_interp : str`
            The image interpolation to be used. Options are ``'cubic'`` (default)
            to use `scipy.interpolate.CloughTocher2DInterpolator`,
            ``'nearest'`` to use `scipy.spatial.Voronoi` or
            ``'linear'`` to use `scipy.interpolate.LinearNDInterpolator`.

        #### `extrapolate : str`
            Options:

            - ``'box'``
                Extrapolate to four points placed to form a square encompassing all
                data points, where each side of the square is three times the range
                of the data in the respective dimension.
            - ``'local'`` (default for MEG sensors)
                Extrapolate only to nearby points (approximately to points closer than
                median inter-electrode distance). This will also set the
                mask to be polygonal based on the convex hull of the sensors.
            - ``'head'`` (default for non-MEG sensors)
                Extrapolate out to the edges of the clipping circle. This will be on
                the head circle when the sensors are contained within the head circle,
                but it can extend beyond the head when sensors are plotted outside
                the head circle.

            ‚ú® Added in vesion 0.18

            üé≠ Changed in version 0.21

               - The default was changed to ``'local'`` for MEG sensors.
               - ``'local'`` was changed to use a convex hull mask
               - ``'head'`` was changed to extrapolate out to the clipping circle.

        #### `border : float | 'mean'`
            Value to extrapolate to on the topomap borders. If ``'mean'`` (default),
            then each extrapolated point has the average value of its neighbours.

            ‚ú® Added in vesion 0.20

        #### `res : int`
            The resolution of the topomap image (number of pixels along each side).

        #### `size : float`
            Side length of each subplot in inches.

        #### `cmap : matplotlib colormap | (colormap, bool) | 'interactive' | None`
            Colormap to use. If `tuple`, the first value indicates the colormap
            to use and the second value is a boolean defining interactivity. In
            interactive mode the colors are adjustable by clicking and dragging the
            colorbar with left and right mouse button. Left mouse button moves the
            scale up and down and right mouse button adjusts the range. Hitting
            space bar resets the range. Up and down arrows can be used to change
            the colormap. If ``None``, ``'Reds'`` is used for data that is either
            all-positive or all-negative, and ``'RdBu_r'`` is used otherwise.
            ``'interactive'`` is equivalent to ``(None, True)``. Defaults to ``None``.

            ### ‚õîÔ∏è Warning  Interactive mode works smoothly only for a small amount
                of topomaps. Interactive mode is disabled by default for more than
                2 topomaps.

        #### `vlim : tuple of length 2 | 'joint'`
            Colormap limits to use. If a `tuple` of floats, specifies the
            lower and upper bounds of the colormap (in that order); providing
            ``None`` for either entry will set the corresponding boundary at the
            min/max of the data (separately for each topomap). Elements of the `tuple` may also be callable functions which take in a `NumPy array <numpy.ndarray>` and return a scalar. If ``vlim='joint'``, will compute the colormap limits jointly across all topomaps of the same channel type, using the min/max of the data for that channel type. Defaults to ``(None, None)``.

            ‚ú® Added in vesion 1.2

        #### `cnorm : matplotlib.colors.Normalize | None`
            How to normalize the colormap. If ``None``, standard linear normalization
            is performed. If not ``None``, ``vmin`` and ``vmax`` will be ignored.
            See `Matplotlib docs <matplotlib:colormapnorms>`
            for more details on colormap normalization, and
            `the ERDs example<cnorm-example>` for an example of its use.

            ‚ú® Added in vesion 1.2

        #### `colorbar : bool`
            Plot a colorbar in the rightmost column of the figure.
        #### `cbar_fmt : str`
            Formatting string for colorbar tick labels. See `formatspec` for
            details.

        #### `units : dict | str | None`
            The units to use for the colorbar label. Ignored if ``colorbar=False``.
            If ``None`` and ``scalings=None`` the unit is automatically determined, otherwise the label will be "AU" indicating arbitrary units.
            Default is ``None``.
        #### `axes : instance of Axes | list of Axes | None`
            The axes to plot to. If ``None``, a new `matplotlib.figure.Figure`
            will be created with the correct number of axes. If `matplotlib.axes.Axes` are provided (either as a single instance or a `list` of axes), the number of axes provided must match the number of ``times`` provided (unless ``times`` is ``None``).Default is ``None``.
        #### `time_unit : str`
            The units for the time axis, can be "ms" or "s" (default).

            ‚ú® Added in vesion 0.16
        #### `time_format : str | None`
            String format for topomap values. Defaults (None) to "%01d ms" if
            ``time_unit='ms'``, "%0.3f s" if ``time_unit='s'``, and
            "%g" otherwise. Can be an empty string to omit the time label.

        #### `nrows, ncols : int | 'auto'`
            The number of rows and columns of topographies to plot. If either ``nrows``
            or ``ncols`` is ``'auto'``, the necessary number will be inferred. Defaults
            to ``nrows=1, ncols='auto'``. Ignored when times == 'interactive'.

            ‚ú® Added in vesion 0.20
        #### `show : bool`
            Show the figure if ``True``.

        #### `fig : instance of matplotlib.figure.Figure`
           The figure.

        ### üìñ Notes

        When existing ``axes`` are provided and ``colorbar=True``, note that the
        colorbar scale will only accurately reflect topomaps that are generated in
        the same call as the colorbar. Note also that the colorbar will not be
        resized automatically when ``axes`` are provided; use Matplotlib's
        `axes.set_position() <matplotlib.axes.Axes.set_position>` method or
        `gridspec <matplotlib:arranging_axes>` interface to adjust the colorbar
        size yourself.

        When ``time=="interactive"``, the figure will publish and subscribe to the
        following UI events:

            fixed, enabling "turntable-style" rotations. If ``'trackball'``,
            movement along all axes is possible, which provides more freedom of
            movement, but you may incidentally perform unintentional rotations along
            some axes.

        assumptions, see Notes below).

        -----
        ### üõ†Ô∏è Parameters

        #### `noise_cov : list | instance of Covariance | path-like`
            The noise covariance. Can be a string to load a covariance from disk.
        #### `show : bool`
            Show figure if True.

        #### `rank : None | 'info' | 'full' | dict`
            This controls the rank computation that can be read from the
            measurement info or estimated from the data. When a noise covariance
            is used for whitening, this should reflect the rank of that covariance,
            otherwise amplification of noise components can occur in whitening (e.g.,
            often during source localization).

            :data:`python:None`
                The rank will be estimated from the data after proper scaling of
                different channel types.
            ``'info'``
                The rank is inferred from ``info``. If data have been processed
                with Maxwell filtering, the Maxwell filtering header is used.
                Otherwise, the channel counts themselves are used.
                In both cases, the number of projectors is subtracted from
                the (effective) number of channels in the data.
                For example, if Maxwell filtering reduces the rank to 68, with
                two projectors the returned value will be 66.
            ``'full'``
                The rank is assumed to be full, i.e. equal to the
                number of good channels. If a `mne.Covariance` is passed, this can
                make sense if it has been (possibly improperly) regularized without
                taking into account the true data rank.
            `dict`
                Calculate the rank only for a subset of channel types, and explicitly
                specify the rank for the remaining channel types. This can be
                extremely useful if you already `know` the rank of (part of) your
                data, for instance in case you have calculated it earlier.

                This parameter must be a dictionary whose `keys` correspond to
                channel types in the data (e.g. ``'meg'``, ``'mag'``, ``'grad'``,
                ``'eeg'``), and whose `values` are integers representing the
                respective ranks. For example, ``{'mag': 90, 'eeg': 45}`` will assume
                a rank of ``90`` and ``45`` for magnetometer data and EEG data,
                respectively.

                The ranks for all channel types present in the data, but
                `not` specified in the dictionary will be estimated empirically.
                That is, if you passed a dataset containing magnetometer, gradiometer,
                and EEG data together with the dictionary from the previous example,
                only the gradiometer rank would be determined, while the specified
                magnetometer and EEG ranks would be taken for granted.

            The default is ``None``.

        #### `sphere : float | array-like | instance of ConductorModel | None  | 'auto' | 'eeglab'`
            The sphere parameters to use for the head outline. Can be array-like of
            shape (4,) to give the X/Y/Z origin and radius in meters, or a single float
            to give just the radius (origin assumed 0, 0, 0). Can also be an instance
            of a spherical `mne.bem.ConductorModel` to use the origin and
            radius from that object. If ``'auto'`` the sphere is fit to digitization
            points. If ``'eeglab'`` the head circle is defined by EEG electrodes
            ``'Fpz'``, ``'Oz'``, ``'T7'``, and ``'T8'`` (if ``'Fpz'`` is not present,
            it will be approximated from the coordinates of ``'Oz'``). ``None`` (the
            default) is equivalent to ``'auto'`` when enough extra digitization points

        ### üìñ Notes

        If baseline signals match the assumption of Gaussian white noise,
        values should be centered at 0, and be within 2 standard deviations
        (¬±1.96) for 95% of the time points. For the global field power (GFP),
        we expect it to fluctuate around a value of 1.

        If one single covariance object is passed, the GFP panel (bottom)
        will depict different sensor types. If multiple covariance objects are
        passed as a list, the left column will display the whitened evoked
        responses for each channel based on the whitener from the noise covariance
        that has the highest log-likelihood. The left column will depict the
        whitened GFPs based on each estimator separately for each sensor type.
        Instead of numbers of channels the GFP display shows the estimated rank.
        Note. The rank estimation will be printed by the logger
        (if ``verbose=True``) for each noise covariance estimator that is passed.

            Defaults to None.
        #### `times : array of float | None`
            The time points to plot. If None, 10 evenly spaced samples are

        #### `frame_rate : int | None`
            Frame rate for the animation in Hz. If None,
            frame rate = sfreq / 10. Defaults to None.
        #### `butterfly : bool`
            Whether to plot the data as butterfly plot under the topomap.
            Defaults to False.
        #### `blit : bool`
            Whether to use blit to optimize drawing. In general, it is
            recommended to use blit in combination with ``show=True``. If you
            intend to save the animation it is better to disable blit.
            Defaults to True.
        #### `show : bool`
            Whether to show the animation. Defaults to True.
        #### `time_unit : str`
            The units for the time axis, can be "ms" (default in 0.16)
            or "s" (will become the default in 0.17).

            The sphere parameters to use for the head outline. Can be array-like of
            shape (4,) to give the X/Y/Z origin and radius in meters, or a single float

            üé≠ Changed in version 1.1 Added ``'eeglab'`` option.

        #### `image_interp : str`
            The image interpolation to be used. Options are ``'cubic'`` (default)
            to use `scipy.interpolate.CloughTocher2DInterpolator`,
            ``'nearest'`` to use `scipy.spatial.Voronoi` or
            ``'linear'`` to use `scipy.interpolate.LinearNDInterpolator`.

        #### `extrapolate : str`
            Options:

            - ``'box'``
                Extrapolate to four points placed to form a square encompassing all
                data points, where each side of the square is three times the range
                of the data in the respective dimension.
            - ``'local'`` (default for MEG sensors)
                Extrapolate only to nearby points (approximately to points closer than
                median inter-electrode distance). This will also set the
                mask to be polygonal based on the convex hull of the sensors.
            - ``'head'`` (default for non-MEG sensors)
                Extrapolate out to the edges of the clipping circle. This will be on
                the head circle when the sensors are contained within the head circle,
                but it can extend beyond the head when sensors are plotted outside
                the head circle.

        #### `vmin, vmax : float | callable | None`
            Lower and upper bounds of the colormap, in the same units as the data.
            If ``vmin`` and ``vmax`` are both ``None``, they are set at ¬± the
            maximum absolute value of the data (yielding a colormap with midpoint
            at 0). If only one of ``vmin``, ``vmax`` is ``None``, will use

        #### `method : ``'welch'`` | ``'multitaper'```
            Spectral estimation method. ``'welch'`` uses Welch's
            method :footcite:p:`Welch1967`, ``'multitaper'`` uses DPSS
            tapers :footcite:p:`Slepian1978`.
            Default is ``'multitaper'``.
        #### `fmin, fmax : float`
            The lower- and upper-bound on frequencies of interest. Default is ``fmin=0, fmax=np.inf`` (spans all frequencies present in the data).
        #### `tmin, tmax : float | None`
            First and last times to include, in seconds. ``None`` uses the first or
            last time present in the data. Default is ``tmin=None, tmax=None`` (all
            times).
        #### `picks : str | array-like | slice | None`
            Channels to include. Slices and lists of integers will be interpreted as
            channel indices. In lists, channel `type` strings (e.g., ``['meg',
            'eeg']``) will pick channels of those types, channel `name` strings (e.g.,
            ``['MEG0111', 'MEG2623']`` will pick the given channels. Can also be the
            string values "all" to pick all channels, or "data" to pick :term:`data
            channels`. None (default) will pick good data channels (excluding reference
            MEG channels). Note that channels in ``info['bads']`` `will be included` if
            their names or indices are explicitly provided.
        #### `proj : bool`
            Whether to apply SSP projection vectors before spectral estimation.
            Default is ``False``.

        #### `remove_dc : bool`
            If ``True``, the mean is subtracted from each segment before computing
            its spectrum.
        #### `exclude : list of str | 'bads'`
            Channel names to exclude. If ``'bads'``, channels
            in ``info['bads']`` are excluded; pass an empty list to
            include all channels (including "bad" channels, if any).
        #### `n_jobs : int | None`
            The number of jobs to run in parallel. If ``-1``, it is set
            to the number of CPU cores. Requires the `joblib` package.
            ``None`` (default) is a marker for 'unset' that will be interpreted
            as ``n_jobs=1`` (sequential execution) unless the call is performed under
            a `joblib:joblib.parallel_config` context manager that sets another
            value for ``n_jobs``.

        #### `verbose : bool | str | int | None`
            Control verbosity of the logging output. If ``None``, use the default
            verbosity level. See the `logging documentation <tut-logging>` and
            `mne.verbose` for details. Should only be passed as a keyword
            argument.
        **method_kw
            Additional keyword arguments passed to the spectral estimation
            function (e.g., ``n_fft, n_overlap, n_per_seg, average, window``
            for Welch method, or
            ``bandwidth, adaptive, low_bias, normalization`` for multitaper
            method). See `mne.time_frequency.psd_array_welch` and
            `mne.time_frequency.psd_array_multitaper` for details.

        #### `fmin, fmax : float`
            The lower- and upper-bound on frequencies of interest. Default is ``fmin=0, fmax=np.inf`` (spans all frequencies present in the data).
        #### `tmin, tmax : float | None`

            their names or indices are explicitly provided.
        #### `proj : bool`
            Whether to apply SSP projection vectors before spectral estimation.
            Default is ``False``.

        #### `method : ``'welch'`` | ``'multitaper'`` | ``'auto'```
            Spectral estimation method. ``'welch'`` uses Welch's
            method :footcite:p:`Welch1967`, ``'multitaper'`` uses DPSS
            tapers :footcite:p:`Slepian1978`. ``'auto'`` (default) uses Welch's method for continuous data and multitaper for `mne.Epochs` or `mne.Evoked` data.
        #### `average : bool`
            If False, the PSDs of all channels is displayed. No averaging
            is done and parameters area_mode and area_alpha are ignored. When
            False, it is possible to paint an area (hold left mouse button and
            drag) to plot a topomap.
        dB : bool
            Plot Power Spectral Density (PSD), in units (amplitude**2/Hz (dB)) if
            ``dB=True``, and ``estimate='power'`` or ``estimate='auto'``. Plot PSD
            in units (amplitude**2/Hz) if ``dB=False`` and,
            ``estimate='power'``. Plot Amplitude Spectral Density (ASD), in units
            (amplitude/sqrt(Hz)), if ``dB=False`` and ``estimate='amplitude'`` or
            ``estimate='auto'``. Plot ASD, in units (amplitude/sqrt(Hz) (dB)), if
            ``dB=True`` and ``estimate='amplitude'``.
        #### `estimate : str, {'auto', 'power', 'amplitude'}`
            Can be "power" for power spectral density (PSD), "amplitude" for
            amplitude spectrum density (ASD), or "auto" (default), which uses
            "power" when dB is True and "amplitude" otherwise.
        #### `xscale : 'linear' | 'log'`
            Scale of the frequency axis. Default is ``'linear'``.
        #### `area_mode : str | None`
            Mode for plotting area. If 'std', the mean +/- 1 STD (across channels)
            will be plotted. If 'range', the min and max (across channels) will be
            plotted. Bad channels will be excluded from these calculations.
            If None, no area will be plotted. If average=False, no area is plotted.
        #### `area_alpha : float`
            Alpha for the area.
        #### `color : str | tuple`
            A matplotlib-compatible color to use. Has no effect when
            spatial_colors=True.
        #### `line_alpha : float | None`
            Alpha for the PSD line. Can be None (default) to use 1.0 when
            ``average=True`` and 0.1 when ``average=False``.
        #### `spatial_colors : bool`
            Whether to color spectrum lines by channel location. Ignored if
            ``average=True``.
        #### `sphere : float | array-like | instance of ConductorModel | None  | 'auto' | 'eeglab'`
            The sphere parameters to use for the head outline. Can be array-like of
            shape (4,) to give the X/Y/Z origin and radius in meters, or a single float
            to give just the radius (origin assumed 0, 0, 0). Can also be an instance
            of a spherical `mne.bem.ConductorModel` to use the origin and
            radius from that object. If ``'auto'`` the sphere is fit to digitization
            points. If ``'eeglab'`` the head circle is defined by EEG electrodes
            ``'Fpz'``, ``'Oz'``, ``'T7'``, and ``'T8'`` (if ``'Fpz'`` is not present,
            it will be approximated from the coordinates of ``'Oz'``). ``None`` (the
            default) is equivalent to ``'auto'`` when enough extra digitization points
            are available, and (0, 0, 0, 0.095) otherwise.

        #### `ax : instance of Axes | list of Axes | None`
            The axes to plot to. If ``None``, a new `matplotlib.figure.Figure`
            will be created with the correct number of axes. If `matplotlib.axes.Axes` are provided (either as a single instance or a `list` of axes), the number of axes provided must match the number of channel types present in the object..Default is ``None``.
        #### `show : bool`
            Show the figure if ``True``.
        #### `n_jobs : int | None`
            The number of jobs to run in parallel. If ``-1``, it is set
            to the number of CPU cores. Requires the `joblib` package.

            a `joblib:joblib.parallel_config` context manager that sets another
            value for ``n_jobs``.

        #### `verbose : bool | str | int | None`
            Control verbosity of the logging output. If ``None``, use the default
            verbosity level. See the `logging documentation <tut-logging>` and

        #### `index : 'time' | None`
            Kind of index to use for the DataFrame. If ``None``, a sequential
            integer index (`pandas.RangeIndex`) will be used. If ``'time'``, a
            ``pandas.Index`` or `pandas.TimedeltaIndex` will be used
            (depending on the value of ``time_format``).
            Defaults to ``None``.

            For convenience, a ``ch_type`` column is added to facilitate subsetting the resulting DataFrame. Defaults to ``False``.

        #### `time_format : str | None`
            Desired time format. If ``None``, no conversion is applied, and time values

    """## üß† Read evoked dataset(s).

    -----
    ### üõ†Ô∏è Parameters

    #### `fname : path-like`
        The filename, which should end with ``-ave.fif`` or ``-ave.fif.gz``.
    #### `condition : int or str | list of int or str | None`
        The index or list of indices of the evoked dataset to read. FIF files
        can contain multiple datasets. If None, all datasets are returned as a
        list.

    #### `baseline : None | tuple of length 2`
        The time interval to consider as "baseline" when applying baseline
        correction. If ``None``, do not apply baseline correction.
        If a tuple ``(a, b)``, the interval is between ``a`` and ``b``
        (in seconds), including the endpoints.
        If ``a`` is ``None``, the `beginning` of the data is used; and if ``b``
        is ``None``, it is set to the `end` of the interval.
        If ``(None, None)``, the entire time interval is used.

        ### üí° Note The baseline ``(a, b)`` includes both endpoints, i.e. all
                    timepoints ``t`` such that ``a <= t <= b``.

        Correction is applied `to each channel individually` in the following
        way:

        1. Calculate the mean signal of the baseline period.
        2. Subtract this mean from the `entire` ``Evoked``.

        If ``None`` (default), do not apply baseline correction.

        ### üí° Note Note that if the read  `mne.Evoked` objects have already
                  been baseline-corrected, the data retrieved from disk will
                  `always` be baseline-corrected (in fact, only the
                  baseline-corrected version of the data will be saved, so
                  there is no way to undo this procedure). Only `after` the
                  data has been loaded, a custom (additional) baseline
                  correction `may` be optionally applied by passing a tuple
                  here. Passing ``None`` will `not` remove an existing
                  baseline correction, but merely omit the optional, additional
                  baseline correction.
    #### `kind : str`
        Either 'average' or 'standard_error', the type of data to read.
    #### `proj : bool`
        If False, available projectors won't be applied to the data.
    #### `allow_maxshield : bool | str (default False)`
        If True, allow loading of data that has been recorded with internal
        active compensation (MaxShield). Data recorded with MaxShield should
        generally not be loaded directly, but should first be processed using
        SSS/tSSS to remove the compensation signals that may also affect brain
        activity. Can also be "yes" to load without eliciting a warning.

    #### `verbose : bool | str | int | None`
        Control verbosity of the logging output. If ``None``, use the default
        verbosity level. See the `logging documentation <tut-logging>` and
        `mne.verbose` for details. Should only be passed as a keyword
        argument.

    -----
    ### ‚èé Returns

    #### `evoked : Evoked or list of Evoked`
        The evoked dataset(s); one `mne.Evoked` if ``condition`` is an
        integer or string; or a list of `mne.Evoked` if ``condition`` is
        ``None`` or a list.

    üé≠ Changed in version 0.23
        If the read `mne.Evoked` objects had been baseline-corrected before
        saving, this will be reflected in their ``baseline`` attribute after
        reading.

    ### üõ†Ô∏è Parameters

    #### `fname : path-like`
        The file name, which should end with ``-ave.fif`` or ``-ave.fif.gz``.
    #### `evoked : Evoked instance, or list of Evoked instances`
        The evoked dataset, or list of evoked datasets, to save in one file.
        Note that the measurement info from the first evoked instance is used,
        so be sure that information matches.

    #### `on_mismatch : 'raise' | 'warn' | 'ignore'`
        Can be ``'raise'`` (default) to raise an error, ``'warn'`` to emit a
        warning, or ``'ignore'`` to ignore when the device-to-head transformation differs between
        instances.
