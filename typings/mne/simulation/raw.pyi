    Head movements can optionally be simulated using the ``head_pos``

    Parameters
    ----------

    info : mne.Info
        The `mne.Info` object with information about the sensors and methods of measurement. Used for simulation.

        ðŸŽ­ Changed in version 0.18
           Support for `mne.Info`.
    stc : iterable | SourceEstimate | SourceSimulator
        The source estimates to use to simulate data. Each must have the same
        sample rate as the raw data, and the vertices of all stcs in the
        iterable must match. Each entry in the iterable can also be a tuple of
        ``(SourceEstimate, ndarray)`` to allow specifying the stim channel
        (e.g., STI001) data accompany the source estimate.
        See Notes for details.

        ðŸŽ­ Changed in version 0.18
           Support for tuple, iterable of tuple or `mne.SourceEstimate`,
           or `mne.simulation.SourceSimulator`.
    trans : dict | str | None
        Either a transformation filename (usually made using mne_analyze)
        or an info dict (usually opened using read_trans()).
        If string, an ending of ``.fif`` or ``.fif.gz`` will be assumed to
        be in FIF format, any other ending will be assumed to be a text
        file with a 4x4 transformation matrix (like the ``--trans`` MNE-C
        option). If trans is None, an identity transform will be used.
    src : path-like | instance of SourceSpaces | None
        Source space corresponding to the stc. If string, should be a source
        space filename. Can also be an instance of loaded or generated
        SourceSpaces. Can be None if ``forward`` is provided.
    bem : path-like | dict | None
        BEM solution  corresponding to the stc. If string, should be a BEM
        solution filename (e.g., "sample-5120-5120-5120-bem-sol.fif").
        Can be None if ``forward`` is provided.

    head_pos : None | path-like | dict | tuple | array
        Path to the position estimates file. Should be in the format of
        the files produced by MaxFilter. If dict, keys should
        be the time points and entries should be 4x4 ``dev_head_t``
        matrices. If None, the original head position (from
        ``info['dev_head_t']``) will be used. If tuple, should have the
        same format as data returned by ``head_pos_to_trans_rot_t``.
        If array, should be of the form returned by
        `mne.chpi.read_head_pos`.
        See for example :footcite:`LarsonTaulu2017`.
    mindist : float
        Minimum distance between sources and the inner skull boundary
        to use during forward calculation.

    interp : str
        Either ``'hann'``, ``'cos2'`` (default), ``'linear'``, or ``'zero'``, the type of
        forward-solution interpolation to use between forward solutions
        at different head positions.
    n_jobs : int | None
        The number of jobs to run in parallel. If ``-1``, it is set
        to the number of CPU cores. Requires the `joblib` package.
        ``None`` (default) is a marker for 'unset' that will be interpreted
        as ``n_jobs=1`` (sequential execution) unless the call is performed under
        a `joblib:joblib.parallel_config` context manager that sets another
        value for ``n_jobs``.

    use_cps : bool
        Whether to use cortical patch statistics to define normal orientations for
        surfaces (default True).
    forward : instance of Forward | None
        The forward operator to use. If None (default) it will be computed
        using ``bem``, ``trans``, and ``src``. If not None,
        ``bem``, ``trans``, and ``src`` are ignored.

        âœ¨ Added in version 0.17
    first_samp : int
        The first_samp property in the output Raw instance.

        âœ¨ Added in version 0.18
    max_iter : int
        The maximum number of STC iterations to allow.
        This is a sanity parameter to prevent accidental blowups.

        âœ¨ Added in version 0.18

    verbose : bool | str | int | None
        Control verbosity of the logging output. If ``None``, use the default
        verbosity level. See the `logging documentation <tut-logging>` and
        `mne.verbose` for details. Should only be passed as a keyword
        argument.

    Returns
    -------
    raw : instance of Raw
        The simulated raw file.

    Notes
    -----
    **Stim channel encoding**

    By default, the stimulus channel will have the head position number
    (starting at 1) stored in the trigger channel (if available) at the
    t=0 point in each repetition of the ``stc``. If ``stc`` is a tuple of
    ``(SourceEstimate, ndarray)`` the array values will be placed in the
    stim channel aligned with the `mne.SourceEstimate`.

    **Data simulation**

    In the most advanced case where ``stc`` is an iterable of tuples the output
    will be concatenated in time as:

    .. table:: Data alignment and stim channel encoding

    Notes
    -----
    The blink artifacts are generated by:

    1. Random activation times are drawn from an inhomogeneous poisson
       process whose blink rate oscillates between 4.5 blinks/minute
       and 17 blinks/minute based on the low (reading) and high (resting)
       blink rates from :footcite:`BentivoglioEtAl1997`.
    2. The activation kernel is a 250 ms Hanning window.
    3. Two activated dipoles are located in the z=0 plane (in head
       coordinates) at Â±30 degrees away from the y axis (nasion).
    4. Activations affect MEG and EEG channels.

    The scale-factor of the activation function was chosen based on
    visual inspection to yield amplitudes generally consistent with those
    seen in experimental data. Noisy versions of the activation will be
    stored in the first EOG channel in the raw instance, if it exists.

    The ECG artifacts are generated by:

    1. Random inter-beat intervals are drawn from a uniform distribution
       of times corresponding to 40 and 80 beats per minute.
    2. The activation function is the sum of three Hanning windows with
       varying durations and scales to make a more complex waveform.
    3. The activated dipole is located one (estimated) head radius to
       the left (-x) of head center and three head radii below (+z)
       head center; this dipole is oriented in the +x direction.
    4. Activations only affect MEG channels.
