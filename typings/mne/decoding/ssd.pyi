class SSD(BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin):
    """
    Signal decomposition using the Spatio-Spectral Decomposition (SSD).

    SSD seeks to maximize the power at a frequency band of interest while
    simultaneously minimizing it at the flanking (surrounding) frequency bins
    (considered noise). It extremizes the covariance matrices associated with
    signal and noise :footcite:`NikulinEtAl2011`.

    SSD can either be used as a dimensionality reduction method or a
    â€˜denoisedâ€™ low rank factorization method :footcite:`HaufeEtAl2014b`.

    Parameters
    ----------

    info : mne.Info
        The `mne.Info` object with information about the sensors and methods of measurement. Must match the input data.
    filt_params_signal : dict
        Filtering for the frequencies of interest.
    filt_params_noise : dict
        Filtering for the frequencies of non-interest.
    reg : float | str | None (default)
        Which covariance estimator to use.
        If not None (same as 'empirical'), allow regularization for covariance
        estimation. If float, shrinkage is used (0 <= shrinkage <= 1). For str
        options, reg will be passed to method `mne.compute_covariance`.
    n_components : int | None (default None)
        The number of components to extract from the signal.
        If None, the number of components equal to the rank of the data are
        returned (see ``rank``).
    picks : array of int | None (default None)
        The indices of good channels.
    sort_by_spectral_ratio : bool (default True)
        If set to True, the components are sorted according to the spectral
        ratio.
        See Eq. (24) in :footcite:`NikulinEtAl2011`.
    return_filtered : bool (default False)
        If return_filtered is True, data is bandpassed and projected onto the
        SSD components.
    n_fft : int (default None)
       If sort_by_spectral_ratio is set to True, then the SSD sources will be
       sorted according to their spectral ratio which is calculated based on
       `mne.time_frequency.psd_array_welch`. The n_fft parameter sets the
       length of FFT used.
       See `mne.time_frequency.psd_array_welch` for more information.
    cov_method_params : dict | None (default None)
        As in `mne.decoding.SPoC`
        The default is None.
    rank : None | dict | â€˜infoâ€™ | â€˜fullâ€™
        As in `mne.decoding.SPoC`
        This controls the rank computation that can be read from the
        measurement info or estimated from the data, which determines the
        maximum possible number of components.
        See Notes of `mne.compute_rank` for details.
        We recommend to use 'full' when working with epoched data.

    Attributes
    ----------
    filters_ : array, shape (n_channels, n_components)
        The spatial filters to be multiplied with the signal.
    patterns_ : array, shape (n_components, n_channels)
        The patterns for reconstructing the signal from the filtered data.
