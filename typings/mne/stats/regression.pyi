    -----
    ### üõ†Ô∏è Parameters

    #### `inst : instance of Epochs | iterable of SourceEstimate`
        The data to be regressed. Contains all the trials, sensors, and time
        points for the regression. For Source Estimates, accepts either a list
        or a generator object.
    #### `design_matrix : ndarray, shape (n_observations, n_regressors)`
        The regressors to be used. Must be a 2d array with as many rows as
        the first dimension of the data. The first column of this matrix will
        typically consist of ones (intercept column).
    #### `names : array-like | None`
        Optional parameter to name the regressors (i.e., the columns in the
        design matrix). If provided, the length must correspond to the number
        of columns present in design matrix (including the intercept, if
        present). Otherwise, the default names are ``'x0'``, ``'x1'``,
        ``'x2', ‚Ä¶, 'x(n-1)'`` for ``n`` regressors.

    -----
    ### ‚èé Returns

    #### `results : dict of namedtuple`
        For each regressor (key), a namedtuple is provided with the
        following attributes:

            - ``beta`` : regression coefficients
            - ``stderr`` : standard error of regression coefficients
            - ``t_val`` : t statistics (``beta`` / ``stderr``)
            - ``p_val`` : two-sided p-value of t statistic under the t
              distribution
            - ``mlog10_p_val`` : -log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ-transformed p-value.

        The tuple members are numpy arrays. The shape of each numpy array is
        the shape of the data minus the first dimension; e.g., if the shape of
        the original data was ``(n_observations, n_channels, n_timepoints)``,
        then the shape of each of the arrays will be
        ``(n_channels, n_timepoints)``.

    -----
    ### üõ†Ô∏è Parameters

    #### `raw : instance of Raw`
        A raw object. Note: be very careful about data that is not
        downsampled, as the resulting matrices can be enormous and easily
        overload your computer. Typically, 100 Hz sampling rate is
        appropriate - or using the decim keyword (see below).
    #### `events : ndarray of int, shape (n_events, 3)`
        An array where the first column corresponds to samples in raw
        and the last to integer codes in event_id.
    #### `event_id : dict | None`
        As in Epochs; a dictionary where the values may be integers or
        iterables of integers, corresponding to the 3rd column of
        events, and the keys are condition names.
        If None, uses all events in the events array.
    #### `tmin : float | dict`
        If float, gives the lower limit (in seconds) for the time window for
        which all event types' effects are estimated. If a dict, can be used to
        specify time windows for specific event types: keys correspond to keys
        in event_id and/or covariates; for missing values, the default (-.1) is
        used.
    #### `tmax : float | dict`
        If float, gives the upper limit (in seconds) for the time window for
        which all event types' effects are estimated. If a dict, can be used to
        specify time windows for specific event types: keys correspond to keys
        in event_id and/or covariates; for missing values, the default (1.) is
        used.
    #### `covariates : dict-like | None`
        If dict-like (e.g., a pandas DataFrame), values have to be array-like
        and of the same length as the rows in ``events``. Keys correspond
        to additional event types/conditions to be estimated and are matched
        with the time points given by the first column of ``events``. If
        None, only binary events (from event_id) are used.
    #### `reject : None | dict`
        For cleaning raw data before the regression is performed: set up
        rejection parameters based on peak-to-peak amplitude in continuously
        selected subepochs. If None, no rejection is done.
        If dict, keys are types ('grad' | 'mag' | 'eeg' | 'eog' | 'ecg')
        and values are the maximal peak-to-peak values to select rejected
        epochs, e.g.::

            reject = dict(grad=4000e-12, # T / m (gradiometers)
                          mag=4e-11, # T (magnetometers)
                          eeg=40e-5, # V (EEG channels)
                          eog=250e-5 # V (EOG channels))

    #### `flat : None | dict`
        For cleaning raw data before the regression is performed: set up
        rejection parameters based on flatness of the signal. If None, no
        rejection is done. If a dict, keys are ('grad' | 'mag' |
        'eeg' | 'eog' | 'ecg') and values are minimal peak-to-peak values to
        select rejected epochs.
    #### `tstep : float`
        Length of windows for peak-to-peak detection for raw data cleaning.
    #### `decim : int`
        Decimate by choosing only a subsample of data points. Highly
        recommended for data recorded at high sampling frequencies, as
        otherwise huge intermediate matrices have to be created and inverted.
    #### `picks : str | array-like | slice | None`
        Channels to include. Slices and lists of integers will be interpreted as
        channel indices. In lists, channel *type* strings (e.g., ``['meg',
        'eeg']``) will pick channels of those types, channel *name* strings (e.g.,
        ``['MEG0111', 'MEG2623']`` will pick the given channels. Can also be the
        string values "all" to pick all channels, or "data" to pick :term:`data
        channels`. None (default) will pick good data channels. Note that channels
        in ``info['bads']`` *will be included* if their names or indices are
        explicitly provided.
    #### `solver : str | callable`
        Either a function which takes as its inputs the sparse predictor
        matrix X and the observation matrix Y, and returns the coefficient
        matrix b; or a string.
        X is of shape (n_times, n_predictors * time_window_length).
        y is of shape (n_channels, n_times).
        If str, must be ``'cholesky'``, in which case the solver used is
        ``linalg.solve(dot(X.T, X), dot(X.T, y))``.

    -----
    ### ‚èé Returns

    #### `evokeds : dict`
        A dict where the keys correspond to conditions and the values are
        Evoked objects with the ER[F/P]s. These can be used exactly like any
        other Evoked object, including e.g. plotting or statistics.
