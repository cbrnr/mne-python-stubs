class Annotations:
    """## Annotation object for annotating segments of raw data.

    ### üí° Note
       To convert events to `mne.Annotations`, use
       `mne.annotations_from_events`. To convert existing `mne.Annotations`
       to events, use  `mne.events_from_annotations`.

    -----
    ### üõ†Ô∏è Parameters

    #### `onset : array of float, shape (n_annotations,)`
        The starting time of annotations in seconds after ``orig_time``.
    #### `duration : array of float, shape (n_annotations,) | float`
        Durations of the annotations in seconds. If a float, all the
        annotations are given the same duration.
    #### `description : array of str, shape (n_annotations,) | str`
        Array of strings containing description for each annotation. If a
        string, all the annotations are given the same description. To reject
        epochs, use description starting with keyword 'bad'. See example above.
    #### `orig_time : float | str | datetime | tuple of int | None`
        A POSIX Timestamp, datetime or a tuple containing the timestamp as the
        first element and microseconds as the second element. Determines the
        starting time of annotation acquisition. If None (default),
        starting time is determined from beginning of raw data acquisition.
        In general, ``raw.info['meas_date']`` (or None) can be used for syncing
        the annotations with raw data if their acquisition is started at the
        same time. If it is a string, it should conform to the ISO8601 format.
        More precisely to this '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%f' particular case of
        the ISO8601 format where the delimiter between date and time is ' '.

    #### `ch_names : list | None`
        List of lists of channel names associated with the annotations.
        Empty entries are assumed to be associated with no specific channel,
        i.e., with all channels or with the time slice itself. None (default) is
        the same as passing all empty lists. For example, this creates three
        annotations, associating the first with the time interval itself, the
        second with two channels, and the third with a single channel::

            Annotations(onset=[0, 3, 10], duration=[1, 0.25, 0.5],
                        description=['Start', 'BAD_flux', 'BAD_noise'],
                        ch_names=[[], ['MEG0111', 'MEG2563'], ['MEG1443']])

        ‚ú® Added in version 0.23

    ### üëâ See Also

    mne.annotations_from_events
    mne.events_from_annotations

    -----
    ### üìñ Notes

    Annotations are added to instance of `mne.io.Raw` as the attribute
    :attr:`raw.annotations <mne.io.Raw.annotations>`.

    To reject bad epochs using annotations, use
    annotation description starting with 'bad' keyword. The epochs with
    overlapping bad segments are then rejected automatically by default.

    To remove epochs with blinks you can do:

    >>> eog_events = mne.preprocessing.find_eog_events(raw)  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> n_blinks = len(eog_events)  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> onset = eog_events[:, 0] / raw.info['sfreq'] - 0.25  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> duration = np.repeat(0.5, n_blinks)  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> description = ['bad blink'] * n_blinks  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> annotations = mne.Annotations(onset, duration, description)  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> raw.set_annotations(annotations)  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> epochs = mne.Epochs(raw, events, event_id, tmin, tmax)  # doctest: +SKIP

    `ch_names`

    Specifying channel names allows the creation of channel-specific
    annotations. Once the annotations are assigned to a raw instance with
    `mne.io.Raw.set_annotations`, if channels are renamed by the raw
    instance, the annotation channels also get renamed. If channels are dropped
    from the raw instance, any channel-specific annotation that has no channels
    left in the raw instance will also be removed.

    `orig_time`

    If ``orig_time`` is None, the annotations are synced to the start of the
    data (0 seconds). Otherwise the annotations are synced to sample 0 and
    ``raw.first_samp`` is taken into account the same way as with events.

    When setting annotations, the following alignments
    between ``raw.info['meas_date']`` and ``annotation.orig_time`` take place:

    ### ‚õîÔ∏è Warning
       This means that when ``raw.info['meas_date'] is None``, doing
       ``raw.set_annotations(raw.annotations)`` will not alter ``raw`` if and
       only if ``raw.first_samp == 0``. When it's non-zero,
       ``raw.set_annotations`` will assume that the "new" annotations refer to
       the original data (with ``first_samp==0``), and will be re-referenced to
       the new time offset!

    `Specific annotation`

    ``BAD_ACQ_SKIP`` annotation leads to specific reading/writing file
    behaviours. See `mne.io.read_raw_fif` and
    `Raw.save() <mne.io.Raw.save>` notes for details.

        #### `self : instance of Epochs`
            The epochs object with annotations.

        -----
        ### üìñ Notes

        Annotation onsets and offsets are stored as time in seconds (not as
        sample numbers).

        If you have an ``-epo.fif`` file saved to disk created before 1.0,
        annotations can be added correctly only if no decimation or
        resampling was performed. We thus suggest to regenerate your
        `mne.Epochs` from raw and re-save to disk with 1.0+ if you
        want to safely work with `mne.Annotations` in epochs.

        Since this method does not handle offsetting the times based
        on first_samp or measurement dates, the recommended way to add
        Annotations is::

            raw.set_annotations(annotations)
            annotations = raw.annotations
            epochs.set_annotations(annotations)

    makes an `mne.Annotations` object.

    -----
    ### üõ†Ô∏è Parameters

    #### `fname : path-like`
        The filename.
    #### `sfreq : float | ``'auto'```
        The sampling frequency in the file. This parameter is necessary for
        \\*.vmrk, \\*.amrk, and \\*.cef files as Annotations are expressed in
        seconds and \\*.vmrk/\\*.amrk/\\*.cef files are in samples. For any other
        file format, ``sfreq`` is omitted. If set to 'auto' then the ``sfreq``
        is taken from the respective info file of the same name with according
        file extension (\\*.vhdr/\\*.ahdr for brainvision; \\*.dap for Curry 7;
        \\*.cdt.dpa for Curry 8). So data.vmrk/amrk looks for sfreq in
        data.vhdr/ahdr, data.cef looks in data.dap and data.cdt.cef looks in
        data.cdt.dpa.
    uint16_codec : str | None
        This parameter is only used in EEGLAB (\\*.set) and omitted otherwise.
        If your \\*.set file contains non-ascii characters, sometimes reading
        it may fail and give rise to error message stating that "buffer is
        too small". ``uint16_codec`` allows to specify what codec (for example:
        ``'latin1'`` or ``'utf-8'``) should be used when reading character
        arrays and can therefore help you solve this problem.

    #### `encoding : str`
        Encoding of annotations channel(s). Default is "utf8" (the only correct
        encoding according to the EDF+ standard).
        Only used when reading EDF annotations.

    ### ‚èé Returns

    #### `annot : instance of Annotations | None`
        The annotations.

    ### üìñ Notes

    The annotations stored in a ``.csv`` require the onset columns to be
    timestamps. If you have onsets as floats (in seconds), you should use the

    #### `raw : instance of Raw`
        The raw data for which Annotations are defined.
    #### `event_id : dict | callable | None | ``'auto'```
        Can be:

        - `dict`: map descriptions (keys) to integer event codes (values).
          Only the descriptions present will be mapped, others will be ignored.
        - `callable`: must take a string input and return an integer event
          code, or return ``None`` to ignore the event.
        - `None`: Map descriptions to unique integer values based on their
          ``sorted`` order.
        - `'auto' (default)`: prefer a raw-format-specific parser:

          - Brainvision: map stimulus events to their integer part; response
            events to integer part + 1000; optic events to integer part + 2000;
            'SyncStatus/Sync On' to 99998; 'New Segment/' to 99999;
            all others like ``None`` with an offset of 10000.
          - Other raw formats: Behaves like None.

          ‚ú® Added in version 0.18
    #### `regexp : str | None`
        Regular expression used to filter the annotations whose
        descriptions is a match. The default ignores descriptions beginning
        ``'bad'`` or ``'edge'`` (case-insensitive).

        üé≠ Changed in version 0.18
           Default ignores bad and edge descriptions.
    #### `use_rounding : bool`
        If True, use rounding (instead of truncation) when converting
        times to indices. This can help avoid non-unique indices.
    #### `chunk_duration : float | None`
        Chunk duration in seconds. If ``chunk_duration`` is set to None
        (default), generated events correspond to the annotation onsets.
        If not, `mne.events_from_annotations` returns as many events as
        they fit within the annotation duration spaced according to
        ``chunk_duration``. As a consequence annotations with duration shorter
        than ``chunk_duration`` will not contribute events.

    #### `verbose : bool | str | int | None`
        Control verbosity of the logging output. If ``None``, use the default
        verbosity level. See the `logging documentation <tut-logging>` and
        `mne.verbose` for details. Should only be passed as a keyword
        argument.

    For data formats that store integer events as strings (e.g., NeuroScan
    ``.cnt`` files), passing the Python built-in function `int` as the
    ``event_id`` parameter will do what most users probably want in those
    circumstances: return an ``event_id`` dictionary that maps event ``'1'`` to
    integer event code ``1``, ``'2'`` to ``2``, etc.
