            The sphere parameters to use for the head outline. Can be array-like of

            of a spherical `mne.bem.ConductorModel` to use the origin and
            radius from that object. If ``'auto'`` the sphere is fit to digitization

            ``'Fpz'``, ``'Oz'``, ``'T7'``, and ``'T8'`` (if ``'Fpz'`` is not present,

        The only entries that should be manually changed by the user are:
        ``info['bads']``, ``info['description']``, ``info['device_info']``
        ``info['dev_head_t']``, ``info['experimenter']``,
        ``info['helium_info']``, ``info['line_freq']``, ``info['temp']``,
        and ``info['subject_info']``.

        All other entries should be considered read-only, though they can be
        modified by various MNE-Python functions or methods (which have
        safeguards to ensure all fields remain in sync).

    ch_names : list of str | int

    ### üìñ Notes

    The info dictionary will be sparsely populated to enable functionality
    within the rest of the package. Advanced functionality such as source
    localization can only be obtained through substantial, proper
    modifications of the info structure (not recommended).

    Note that the MEG device-to-head transform ``info['dev_head_t']`` will
    be initialized to the identity transform.

    Proper units of measure:

    * V: eeg, eog, seeg, dbs, emg, ecg, bio, ecog
    * T: mag
    * T/m: grad
    * M: hbo, hbr
    * Am: dipole

    ### ‚õîÔ∏è Warning If ``info`` is part of an object like
                 `raw.info <mne.io.Raw>`, you should directly use
                 the method `raw.anonymize() <mne.io.Raw.anonymize>`

    ### üõ†Ô∏è Parameters


    info : mne.Info
        The `mne.Info` object with information about the sensors and methods of measurement.

    daysback : int | None
        Number of days to subtract from all dates.
        If ``None`` (default), the acquisition date, ``info['meas_date']``,
        will be set to ``January 1À¢·µó, 2000``. This parameter is ignored if
        ``info['meas_date']`` is ``None`` (i.e., no acquisition date has been set).

    keep_his : bool
        If ``True``, ``his_id`` of ``subject_info`` will **not** be overwritten.
        Defaults to ``False``.

        ### ‚õîÔ∏è Warning This could mean that ``info`` is not fully
                     anonymized. Use with caution.

    verbose : bool | str | int | None
        Control verbosity of the logging output. If ``None``, use the default

    info : instance of Info

    ### üìñ Notes


    Removes potentially identifying information if it exists in ``info``.
    Specifically for each of the following we use:

    - meas_date, file_id, meas_id
            A default value, or as specified by ``daysback``.
    - subject_info
            Default values, except for 'birthday' which is adjusted
            to maintain the subject age.
    - experimenter, proj_name, description
            Default strings.
    - utc_offset
            ``None``.
    - proj_id
            Zeros.
    - proc_history
            Dates use the ``meas_date`` logic, and experimenter a default string.
    - helium_info, device_info
            Dates use the ``meas_date`` logic, meta info uses defaults.

    If ``info['meas_date']`` is ``None``, it will remain ``None`` during processing
    the above fields.
