              ``iir_params['ftype']`` exist, these will be used with
              `scipy.signal.iirfilter` to make a filter.
              You should also supply ``iir_params['rs']`` and
              ``iir_params['rp']`` if using elliptic or Chebychev filters.
            * Otherwise, if ``iir_params['gpass']`` and
              ``iir_params['gstop']`` exist, these will be used with

    f_pass : float or list of float
        Frequency for the pass-band. Low-pass and high-pass filters should
        be a float, band-pass should be a 2-element list of float.
    f_stop : float or list of float
        Stop-band frequency (same size as f_pass). Not used if 'order' is

    return_copy : bool
        If False, the 'sos', 'b', 'a', and 'padlen' entries in

    -----
    This function triages calls to `scipy.signal.iirfilter` and
    `scipy.signal.iirdesign` based on the input arguments (see
    linked functions for more details).

    üé≠ Changed in version 0.14
       Second-order sections are used in filter design by default (replacing
       ``output='ba'`` by ``output='sos'``) to help ensure filter stability
       and reduce numerical error.

    Examples
    --------
    iir_params can have several forms. Consider constructing a low-pass
    filter at 40 Hz with 1000 Hz sampling rate.

    In the most basic (2-parameter) form of iir_params, the order of the
    filter 'N' and the type of filtering 'ftype' are specified. To get
    coefficients for a 4th-order Butterworth filter, this would be:

    >>> iir_params = dict(order=4, ftype='butter', output='sos')  # doctest:+SKIP
    >>> iir_params = construct_iir_filter(iir_params, 40, None, 1000, 'low', return_copy=False)  # doctest:+SKIP
    >>> print((2 * len(iir_params['sos']), iir_params['padlen']))  # doctest:+SKIP
    (4, 82)

    Filters can also be constructed using filter design methods. To get a
    40 Hz Chebyshev type 1 lowpass with specific gain characteristics in the
    pass and stop bands (assuming the desired stop band is at 45 Hz), this
    would be a filter with much longer ringing:

    >>> iir_params = dict(ftype='cheby1', gpass=3, gstop=20, output='sos')  # doctest:+SKIP
    >>> iir_params = construct_iir_filter(iir_params, 40, 50, 1000, 'low')  # doctest:+SKIP
    >>> print((2 * len(iir_params['sos']), iir_params['padlen']))  # doctest:+SKIP
    (6, 439)

    Padding and/or filter coefficients can also be manually specified. For
    a 10-sample moving window with no padding during filtering, for example,
    one can just do:

    >>> iir_params = dict(b=np.ones((10)), a=[1, 0], padlen=0)  # doctest:+SKIP
    >>> iir_params = construct_iir_filter(iir_params, return_copy=False)  # doctest:+SKIP
    >>> print((iir_params['b'], iir_params['a'], iir_params['padlen']))  # doctest:+SKIP
    (array([1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1.]), [1, 0], 0)

    `disc-filtering` and `tut-filter-resample`.

              is given by ``l_freq`` or ``h_freq`` directly, and
              ``l_trans_bandwidth`` and ``h_trans_bandwidth`` are ignored.

        * Fs2 = Fp2 + h_trans_bandwidth in Hz

    **Band-stop filter**

    The frequency response is (approximately) given by::

          0       Fp1  Fs1       Fs2  Fp2      Nyq

    Where ``Fs1 = Fp1 + l_trans_bandwidth`` and
    ``Fs2 = Fp2 - h_trans_bandwidth``.

    Multiple stop bands can be specified using arrays.

    **Low-pass filter**

    The frequency response is (approximately) given by::

        1-|------------------------
          |                        \\

    """### Notch filter for the signal x.

    Applies a zero-phase notch filter to the signal x, operating on the last
    dimension.

    ### üõ†Ô∏è Parameters
    ----------
    x : array
        Signal to filter.
    Fs : float
        Sampling rate in Hz.
    freqs : float | array of float | None
        Frequencies to notch filter in Hz, e.g. np.arange(60, 241, 60).
        Multiple stop-bands can only be used with method='fir'
        and method='spectrum_fit'. None can only be used with the mode
        'spectrum_fit', where an F test is used to find sinusoidal components.

    filter_length : str | int
        Length of the FIR filter to use (if applicable):

        * **'auto' (default)**: The filter length is chosen based
          on the size of the transition regions (6.6 times the reciprocal
          of the shortest transition band for fir_window='hamming'
          and fir_design="firwin2", and half that for "firwin").
        * **str**: A human-readable time in
          units of "s" or "ms" (e.g., "10s" or "5500ms") will be
          converted to that number of samples if ``phase="zero"``, or
          the shortest power-of-two length at least that duration for
          ``phase="zero-double"``.
        * **int**: Specified length in samples. For fir_design="firwin",
          this should not be used.

        When ``method=='spectrum_fit'``, this sets the effective window duration
        over which fits are computed. See `mne.filter.create_filter`
        for options. Longer window lengths will give more stable frequency
        estimates, but require (potentially much) more processing and are not able
        to adapt as well to non-stationarities.

        The default in 0.21 is None, but this will change to ``'10s'`` in 0.22.
    notch_widths : float | array of float | None
        Width of the stop band (centred at each freq in freqs) in Hz.
        If None, freqs / 200 is used.
    trans_bandwidth : float
        Width of the transition band in Hz.
        Only used for ``method='fir'`` and ``method='iir'``.

    method : str
        ``'fir'`` will use overlap-add FIR filtering, ``'iir'`` will use IIR
        forward-backward filtering (via `scipy.signal.filtfilt`).
        'spectrum_fit' will use multi-taper estimation of sinusoidal
        components. If freqs=None and method='spectrum_fit', significant
        sinusoidal components are detected using an F test, and noted by
        logging.

    iir_params : dict | None
        Dictionary of parameters to use for IIR filtering.
        If ``iir_params=None`` and ``method="iir"``, 4th order Butterworth will be used.
        For more information, see `mne.filter.construct_iir_filter`.
    mt_bandwidth : float | None
        The bandwidth of the multitaper windowing function in Hz.
        Only used in 'spectrum_fit' mode.
    p_value : float
        P-value to use in F-test thresholding to determine significant
        sinusoidal components to remove when method='spectrum_fit' and
        freqs=None. Note that this will be Bonferroni corrected for the
        number of frequencies, so large p-values may be justified.
    picks : list | slice | None
        Channels to include. Slices and lists of integers will be interpreted as channel indices.
        None (default) will pick all channels. Note that channels in ``info['bads']`` *will be included* if their indices are explicitly provided.
        Only supported for 2D (n_channels, n_times) and 3D
        (n_epochs, n_channels, n_times) data.

    n_jobs : int | str
        Number of jobs to run in parallel. Can be ``'cuda'`` if ``cupy``
        is installed properly and ``method='fir'``.
    copy : bool
        If True, a copy of x, filtered, is returned. Otherwise, it operates
        on x in place.

    phase : str
        Phase of the filter.
        When ``method='fir'``, symmetric linear-phase FIR filters are constructed,
        and if ``phase='zero'`` (default), the delay of this filter is compensated
        for, making it non-causal. If ``phase='zero-double'``,
        then this filter is applied twice, once forward, and once backward
        (also making it non-causal). If ``'minimum'``, then a minimum-phase filter
        will be constructed and applied, which is causal but has weaker stop-band
        suppression.
        When ``method='iir'``, ``phase='zero'`` (default) or
        ``phase='zero-double'`` constructs and applies IIR filter twice, once
        forward, and once backward (making it non-causal) using
        `scipy.signal.filtfilt`.
        If ``phase='forward'``, it constructs and applies forward IIR filter using
        `scipy.signal.lfilter`.

        ‚ú® Added in vesion 0.13

    fir_window : str
        The window to use in FIR design, can be "hamming" (default),
        "hann" (default in 0.13), or "blackman".

        ‚ú® Added in vesion 0.15

    fir_design : str
        Can be "firwin" (default) to use `scipy.signal.firwin`,
        or "firwin2" to use `scipy.signal.firwin2`. "firwin" uses
        a time-domain design technique that generally gives improved
        attenuation using fewer samples than "firwin2".

        ‚ú® Added in vesion 0.15

    pad : str
        The type of padding to use. Supports all `numpy.pad` ``mode``
        options. Can also be ``"reflect_limited"``, which pads with a
        reflected version of each vector mirrored on the first and last values
        of the vector, followed by zeros.

        Only used for ``method='fir'``.
        The default is ``'reflect_limited'``.

    verbose : bool | str | int | None
        Control verbosity of the logging output. If ``None``, use the default
        verbosity level. See the `logging documentation <tut-logging>` and
        `mne.verbose` for details. Should only be passed as a keyword

    compatibility in case we decide to use an upfirdn implementation. The
    current implementation is functionally equivalent to passing
    up=up/down and down=1.

            If ``iir_params=None`` and ``method="iir"``, 4th order Butterworth will be used.
            For more information, see `mne.filter.construct_iir_filter`.

        phase : str
            Phase of the filter.
            When ``method='fir'``, symmetric linear-phase FIR filters are constructed,
            and if ``phase='zero'`` (default), the delay of this filter is compensated
            for, making it non-causal. If ``phase='zero-double'``,
            then this filter is applied twice, once forward, and once backward
            (also making it non-causal). If ``'minimum'``, then a minimum-phase filter
            will be constructed and applied, which is causal but has weaker stop-band
            suppression.
            When ``method='iir'``, ``phase='zero'`` (default) or
            ``phase='zero-double'`` constructs and applies IIR filter twice, once
            forward, and once backward (making it non-causal) using
            `scipy.signal.filtfilt`.
            If ``phase='forward'``, it constructs and applies forward IIR filter using
            `scipy.signal.lfilter`.

        fir_window : str
            The window to use in FIR design, can be "hamming" (default),
            "hann" (default in 0.13), or "blackman".

        fir_design : str
            Can be "firwin" (default) to use `scipy.signal.firwin`,
            or "firwin2" to use `scipy.signal.firwin2`. "firwin" uses
            a time-domain design technique that generally gives improved
            attenuation using fewer samples than "firwin2".

        skip_by_annotation : str | list of str
            If a string (or list of str), any annotation segment that begins
            with the given string will not be included in filtering, and
            segments on either side of the given excluded annotated segment
            will be filtered separately (i.e., as independent signals).
            The default (``('edge', 'bad_acq_skip')`` will separately filter
            any segments that were concatenated by `mne.concatenate_raws`
            or `mne.io.Raw.append`, or separated during acquisition.
            To disable, provide an empty list. Only used if ``inst`` is raw.

        pad : str
            The type of padding to use. Supports all `numpy.pad` ``mode``
            options. Can also be ``"reflect_limited"``, which pads with a
            reflected version of each vector mirrored on the first and last values
            of the vector, followed by zeros.

            Only used for ``method='fir'``.

        verbose : bool | str | int | None
            Control verbosity of the logging output. If ``None``, use the default
            verbosity level. See the `logging documentation <tut-logging>` and
            `mne.verbose` for details. Should only be passed as a keyword
            argument.

        Applies a zero-phase low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, or band-stop
        filter to the channels selected by ``picks``.
        The data are modified inplace.

        The object has to have the data loaded e.g. with ``preload=True``
        or ``self.load_data()``.

        ``l_freq`` and ``h_freq`` are the frequencies below which and above
        which, respectively, to filter out of the data. Thus the uses are:

            * ``l_freq < h_freq``: band-pass filter
            * ``l_freq > h_freq``: band-stop filter
            * ``l_freq is not None and h_freq is None``: high-pass filter
            * ``l_freq is None and h_freq is not None``: low-pass filter

        ``self.info['lowpass']`` and ``self.info['highpass']`` are only
        updated with picks=None.

        ### üí° Note If n_jobs > 1, more memory is required as
                  ``len(picks) * n_times`` additional time points need to
                  be temporarily stored in memory.

            'eeg']``) will pick channels of those types, channel *name* strings (e.g.,

        envelope : bool

            See Notes.
        n_jobs : int | None
            The number of jobs to run in parallel. If ``-1``, it is set
            to the number of CPU cores. Requires the `joblib` package.
            ``None`` (default) is a marker for 'unset' that will be interpreted
            as ``n_jobs=1`` (sequential execution) unless the call is performed under
            a `joblib:joblib.parallel_config` context manager that sets another
            value for ``n_jobs``.
        n_fft : int | None | str
            Points to use in the FFT for Hilbert transformation. The signal

        ### üìñ Notes

        **Parameters**

        If ``envelope=False``, the analytic signal for the channels defined in
        ``picks`` is computed and the data of the Raw object is converted to
        a complex representation (the analytic signal is complex valued).

        If ``envelope=True``, the absolute value of the analytic signal for the
        channels defined in ``picks`` is computed, resulting in the envelope
        signal.

        .. warning: Do not use ``envelope=True`` if you intend to compute
                    an inverse solution from the raw data. If you want to
                    compute the envelope in source space, use
                    ``envelope=False`` and compute the envelope after the
                    inverse solution has been obtained.

        If envelope=False, more memory is required since the original raw data
        as well as the analytic signal have temporarily to be stored in memory.
        If n_jobs > 1, more memory is required as ``len(picks) * n_times``
        additional time points need to be temporarily stored in memory.

        Also note that the ``n_fft`` parameter will allow you to pad the signal
        with zeros before performing the Hilbert transform. This padding
        is cut off, but it may result in a slightly different result
        (particularly around the edges). Use at your own risk.

        **Analytic signal**

        The analytic signal "x_a(t)" of "x(t)" is::

            x_a = F^{-1}(F(x) 2U) = x + i y

        where "F" is the Fourier transform, "U" the unit step function,
        and "y" the Hilbert transform of "x". One usage of the analytic
        signal is the computation of the envelope signal, which is given by
        "e(t) = abs(x_a(t))". Due to the linearity of Hilbert transform and the
        MNE inverse solution, the enevlope in source space can be obtained
        by computing the analytic signal in sensor space, applying the MNE
        inverse, and computing the envelope in source space.
