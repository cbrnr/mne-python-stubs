    ### üõ†Ô∏è Parameters

    #### `inst : instance of Epochs | Raw`
        The instance to process.
    #### `picks : str | array-like | slice | None`
        Channels to include. Slices and lists of integers will be interpreted as
        channel indices. In lists, channel *type* strings (e.g., ``['meg',
        'eeg']``) will pick channels of those types, channel *name* strings (e.g.,
        ``['MEG0111', 'MEG2623']`` will pick the given channels. Can also be the
        string values "all" to pick all channels, or "data" to pick :term:`data
        channels`. None (default) will pick good data channels. Note that channels
        in ``info['bads']`` *will be included* if their names or indices are
        explicitly provided.
    #### `exclude : list | 'bads'`
        List of channels to exclude from the regression, only used when picking
        based on types (e.g., exclude="bads" when picks="meg").
        Specify ``'bads'`` (the default) to exclude all channels marked as bad.

        ‚ú® Added in vesion 1.2
    #### `picks_artifact : array-like | str`
        Channel picks to use as predictor/explanatory variables capturing
        the artifact of interest (default is "eog").
    #### `betas : ndarray, shape (n_picks, n_picks_ref) | None`
        The regression coefficients to use. If None (default), they will be
        estimated from the data.
    #### `proj : bool`
        Whether to automatically apply SSP projection vectors before performing
        the regression. Default is ``True``.
    #### `copy : bool`
        If True (default), copy the instance before modifying it.

    #### `verbose : bool | str | int | None`
        Control verbosity of the logging output. If ``None``, use the default
        verbosity level. See the `logging documentation <tut-logging>` and
        `mne.verbose` for details. Should only be passed as a keyword
        argument.

    -----
    ### ‚èé Returns

    #### `inst : instance of Epochs | Raw`
        The processed data.
    #### `betas : ndarray, shape (n_picks, n_picks_ref)`
        The betas used during regression.

    -----
    ### üìñ Notes

    To implement the method outlined in :footcite:`GrattonEtAl1983`,
    remove the evoked response from epochs before estimating the
    regression coefficients, then apply those regression coefficients to the
    original data in two calls like (here for a single-condition ``epochs``
    only):

        >>> epochs_no_ave = epochs.copy().subtract_evoked()  # doctest:+SKIP
        >>> _, betas = mne.preprocessing.regress(epochs_no_ave)  # doctest:+SKIP
        >>> epochs_clean, _ = mne.preprocessing.regress(epochs, betas=betas)  # doctest:+SKIP

        ### üõ†Ô∏è Parameters

        #### `ch_type : 'mag' | 'grad' | 'planar1' | 'planar2' | 'eeg' | None`
            The channel type to plot. For ``'grad'``, the gradiometers are
            collected in pairs and the RMS for each pair is plotted. If
            ``None`` the first available channel type from order shown above is used. Defaults to ``None``.

        #### `sensors : bool | str`
            Whether to add markers for sensor locations. If `str`, should be a
            valid matplotlib format string (e.g., ``'r+'`` for red plusses, see the
            Notes section of `matplotlib.axes.Axes.plot`). If ``True`` (the
            default), black circles will be used.

        #### `show_names : bool | callable`
            If ``True``, show channel names next to each sensor marker. If callable,
            channel names will be formatted using the callable; e.g., to
            delete the prefix 'MEG ' from all channel names, pass the function
            ``lambda x: x.replace('MEG ', '')``. If ``mask`` is not ``None``, only
            non-masked sensor names will be shown.

        #### `mask : ndarray of bool, shape (n_channels,) | None`
            Array indicating channel(s) to highlight with a distinct
            plotting style. Array elements set to ``True`` will be plotted
            with the parameters given in ``mask_params``. Defaults to ``None``,
            equivalent to an array of all ``False`` elements.

        #### `mask_params : dict | None`
            Additional plotting parameters for plotting significant sensors.
            Default (None) equals::

                dict(marker='o', markerfacecolor='w', markeredgecolor='k',
                        linewidth=0, markersize=4)

        #### `contours : int | array-like`
            The number of contour lines to draw. If ``0``, no contours will be drawn.
            If a positive integer, that number of contour levels are chosen using the
            matplotlib tick locator (may sometimes be inaccurate, use array for
            accuracy). If array-like, the array values are used as the contour levels.
            The values should be in ¬µV for EEG, fT for magnetometers and fT/m for
            gradiometers. If ``colorbar=True``, the colorbar will have ticks
            corresponding to the contour levels. Default is ``6``.

        #### `outlines : 'head' | dict | None`
            The outlines to be drawn. If 'head', the default head scheme will be
            drawn. If dict, each key refers to a tuple of x and y positions, the values
            in 'mask_pos' will serve as image mask.
            Alternatively, a matplotlib patch object can be passed for advanced
            masking options, either directly or as a function that returns patches
            (required for multi-axis plots). If None, nothing will be drawn.
            Defaults to 'head'.
        #### `sphere : float | array-like | instance of ConductorModel | None  | 'auto' | 'eeglab'`
            The sphere parameters to use for the head outline. Can be array-like of
            shape (4,) to give the X/Y/Z origin and radius in meters, or a single float
            to give just the radius (origin assumed 0, 0, 0). Can also be an instance
            of a spherical `mne.bem.ConductorModel` to use the origin and
            radius from that object. If ``'auto'`` the sphere is fit to digitization
            points. If ``'eeglab'`` the head circle is defined by EEG electrodes
            ``'Fpz'``, ``'Oz'``, ``'T7'``, and ``'T8'`` (if ``'Fpz'`` is not present,
            it will be approximated from the coordinates of ``'Oz'``). ``None`` (the
            default) is equivalent to ``'auto'`` when enough extra digitization points
            are available, and (0, 0, 0, 0.095) otherwise.

            ‚ú® Added in vesion 0.20
            üé≠ Changed in version 1.1 Added ``'eeglab'`` option.

        #### `image_interp : str`
            The image interpolation to be used. Options are ``'cubic'`` (default)
            to use `scipy.interpolate.CloughTocher2DInterpolator`,
            ``'nearest'`` to use `scipy.spatial.Voronoi` or
            ``'linear'`` to use `scipy.interpolate.LinearNDInterpolator`.

        #### `extrapolate : str`
            Options:

            - ``'box'``
                Extrapolate to four points placed to form a square encompassing all
                data points, where each side of the square is three times the range
                of the data in the respective dimension.
            - ``'local'`` (default for MEG sensors)
                Extrapolate only to nearby points (approximately to points closer than
                median inter-electrode distance). This will also set the
                mask to be polygonal based on the convex hull of the sensors.
            - ``'head'`` (default for non-MEG sensors)
                Extrapolate out to the edges of the clipping circle. This will be on
                the head circle when the sensors are contained within the head circle,
                but it can extend beyond the head when sensors are plotted outside
                the head circle.

            üé≠ Changed in version 0.21

               - The default was changed to ``'local'`` for MEG sensors.
               - ``'local'`` was changed to use a convex hull mask
               - ``'head'`` was changed to extrapolate out to the clipping circle.

        #### `border : float | 'mean'`
            Value to extrapolate to on the topomap borders. If ``'mean'`` (default),
            then each extrapolated point has the average value of its neighbours.

            ‚ú® Added in vesion 0.20

        #### `res : int`
            The resolution of the topomap image (number of pixels along each side).

        #### `size : float`
            Side length of each subplot in inches.

        #### `cmap : matplotlib colormap | (colormap, bool) | 'interactive' | None`
            Colormap to use. If `tuple`, the first value indicates the colormap
            to use and the second value is a boolean defining interactivity. In
            interactive mode the colors are adjustable by clicking and dragging the
            colorbar with left and right mouse button. Left mouse button moves the
            scale up and down and right mouse button adjusts the range. Hitting
            space bar resets the range. Up and down arrows can be used to change
            the colormap. If ``None``, ``'Reds'`` is used for data that is either
            all-positive or all-negative, and ``'RdBu_r'`` is used otherwise.
            ``'interactive'`` is equivalent to ``(None, True)``. Defaults to ``None``.

            ### ‚õîÔ∏è Warning  Interactive mode works smoothly only for a small amount
                of topomaps. Interactive mode is disabled by default for more than
                2 topomaps.

        #### `vlim : tuple of length 2`
            Colormap limits to use. If a `tuple` of floats, specifies the
            lower and upper bounds of the colormap (in that order); providing
            ``None`` for either entry will set the corresponding boundary at the
            min/max of the data. Defaults to ``(None, None)``.

        #### `cnorm : matplotlib.colors.Normalize | None`
            How to normalize the colormap. If ``None``, standard linear normalization
            is performed. If not ``None``, ``vmin`` and ``vmax`` will be ignored.
            See `Matplotlib docs <matplotlib:colormapnorms>`
            for more details on colormap normalization, and
            `the ERDs example<cnorm-example>` for an example of its use.
        #### `axes : instance of Axes | list of Axes | None`
            The axes to plot to. If ``None``, a new `matplotlib.figure.Figure`
            will be created with the correct number of axes. If `matplotlib.axes.Axes` are provided (either as a single instance or a `list` of axes), the number of axes provided must match the number of ``times`` provided (unless ``times`` is ``None``).Default is ``None``.

        #### `colorbar : bool`
            Plot a colorbar in the rightmost column of the figure.
        #### `cbar_fmt : str`
            Formatting string for colorbar tick labels. See `formatspec` for
            details.

        #### `title : str | None`
            The title of the generated figure. If ``None`` (default), no title is
            displayed.
        #### `show : bool`
            Show the figure if ``True``.

        -----
        ### ‚èé Returns

        #### `fig : instance of matplotlib.figure.Figure`
