    """Implementation of the Xdawn Algorithm compatible with scikit-learn.

    Xdawn is a spatial filtering method designed to improve the signal
    to signal + noise ratio (SSNR) of the event related responses. Xdawn was
    originally designed for P300 evoked potential by enhancing the target
    response with respect to the non-target response. This implementation is a
    generalization to any type of event related response.

    ðŸ’¡ _XdawnTransformer does not correct for epochs overlap. To correct
              overlaps see ``Xdawn``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_components : int (default 2)
        The number of components to decompose the signals.
    reg : float | str | None (default None)
        If not None (same as ``'empirical'``, default), allow
        regularization for covariance estimation.
        If float, shrinkage is used (0 <= shrinkage <= 1).
        For str options, ``reg`` will be passed to ``method`` to
        `mne.compute_covariance`.
    signal_cov : None | Covariance | array, shape (n_channels, n_channels)
        The signal covariance used for whitening of the data.
        if None, the covariance is estimated from the epochs signal.
    method_params : dict | None
        Parameters to pass to `mne.compute_covariance`.
