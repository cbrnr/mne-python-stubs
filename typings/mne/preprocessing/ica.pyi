class ICA(ContainsMixin):
    """Data decomposition using Independent Component Analysis (ICA).

    This object estimates independent components from `mne.io.Raw`,
    `mne.Epochs`, or `mne.Evoked` objects. Components can
    optionally be removed (for artifact repair) prior to signal reconstruction.

    ### ‚õîÔ∏è Warning ICA is sensitive to low-frequency drifts and therefore
                 requires the data to be high-pass filtered prior to fitting.
                 Typically, a cutoff frequency of 1 Hz is recommended.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_components : int | float | None
        Number of principal components (from the pre-whitening PCA step) that
        are passed to the ICA algorithm during fitting:

        - `int`
            Must be greater than 1 and less than or equal to the number of
            channels.
        - `float` between 0 and 1 (exclusive)
            Will select the smallest number of components required to explain
            the cumulative variance of the data greater than ``n_components``.
            Consider this hypothetical example: we have 3 components, the first
            explaining 70%, the second 20%, and the third the remaining 10%
            of the variance. Passing 0.8 here (corresponding to 80% of
            explained variance) would yield the first two components,
            explaining 90% of the variance: only by using both components the
            requested threshold of 80% explained variance can be exceeded. The
            third component, on the other hand, would be excluded.
        - ``None``
            ``0.999999`` will be used. This is done to avoid numerical
            stability problems when whitening, particularly when working with
            rank-deficient data.

        Defaults to ``None``. The actual number used when executing the
        `ICA.fit` method will be stored in the attribute
        ``n_components_`` (note the trailing underscore).

        üé≠ Changed in version 0.22
           For a `python:float`, the number of components will account
           for *greater than* the given variance level instead of *less than or
           equal to* it. The default (None) will also take into account the
           rank deficiency of the data.
    noise_cov : None | instance of Covariance
        Noise covariance used for pre-whitening. If None (default), channels
        are scaled to unit variance ("z-standardized") as a group by channel
        type prior to the whitening by PCA.

    random_state : None | int | instance of ~numpy.random.RandomState
        A seed for the NumPy random number generator (RNG). If ``None`` (default),
        the seed will be  obtained from the operating system
        (see  `numpy.random.RandomState` for details), meaning it will most
        likely produce different output every time this function or method is run.
        To achieve reproducible results, pass a value here to explicitly initialize
        the RNG with a defined state.
    method : 'fastica' | 'infomax' | 'picard'
        The ICA method to use in the fit method. Use the ``fit_params`` argument
        to set additional parameters. Specifically, if you want Extended
        Infomax, set ``method='infomax'`` and ``fit_params=dict(extended=True)``
        (this also works for ``method='picard'``). Defaults to ``'fastica'``.
        For reference, see :footcite:`Hyvarinen1999,BellSejnowski1995,LeeEtAl1999,AblinEtAl2018`.
    fit_params : dict | None
        Additional parameters passed to the ICA estimator as specified by
        ``method``. Allowed entries are determined by the various algorithm
        implementations: see `sklearn.decomposition.FastICA`,
        `picard.picard`, `mne.preprocessing.infomax`.
    max_iter : int | 'auto'
        Maximum number of iterations during fit. If ``'auto'``, it
        will set maximum iterations to ``1000`` for ``'fastica'``
        and to ``500`` for ``'infomax'`` or ``'picard'``. The actual number of
        iterations it took `ICA.fit` to complete will be stored in the
        ``n_iter_`` attribute.
    allow_ref_meg : bool
        Allow ICA on MEG reference channels. Defaults to False.

        ‚ú® Added in version 0.18

    verbose : bool | str | int | None
        Control verbosity of the logging output. If ``None``, use the default
        verbosity level. See the `logging documentation <tut-logging>` and
        `mne.verbose` for details. Should only be passed as a keyword
        argument.

    Attributes
    ----------
    current_fit : 'unfitted' | 'raw' | 'epochs'
        Which data type was used for the fit.
    ch_names : list-like
        Channel names resulting from initial picking.
    n_components_ : int
        If fit, the actual number of PCA components used for ICA decomposition.
    pre_whitener_ : ndarray, shape (n_channels, 1) or (n_channels, n_channels)
        If fit, array used to pre-whiten the data prior to PCA.
    pca_components_ : ndarray, shape ``(n_channels, n_channels)``
        If fit, the PCA components.
    pca_mean_ : ndarray, shape (n_channels,)
        If fit, the mean vector used to center the data before doing the PCA.
    pca_explained_variance_ : ndarray, shape ``(n_channels,)``
        If fit, the variance explained by each PCA component.
    mixing_matrix_ : ndarray, shape ``(n_components_, n_components_)``
        If fit, the whitened mixing matrix to go back from ICA space to PCA
        space.
        It is, in combination with the ``pca_components_``, used by
        `ICA.apply` and `ICA.get_components` to re-mix/project
        a subset of the ICA components into the observed channel space.
        The former method also removes the pre-whitening (z-scaling) and the
        de-meaning.
    unmixing_matrix_ : ndarray, shape ``(n_components_, n_components_)``
        If fit, the whitened matrix to go from PCA space to ICA space.
        Used, in combination with the ``pca_components_``, by the methods
        `ICA.get_sources` and `ICA.apply` to unmix the observed
        data.
    exclude : array-like of int
        List or np.array of sources indices to exclude when re-mixing the data
        in the `ICA.apply` method, i.e. artifactual ICA components.
        The components identified manually and by the various automatic
        artifact detection methods should be (manually) appended
        (e.g. ``ica.exclude.extend(eog_inds)``).
        (There is also an ``exclude`` parameter in the `ICA.apply`
        method.) To scrap all marked components, set this attribute to an empty
        list.

    info : mne.Info | None
        The `mne.Info` object with information about the sensors and methods of measurement.
    n_samples_ : int
        The number of samples used on fit.
    labels_ : dict
        A dictionary of independent component indices, grouped by types of
        independent components. This attribute is set by some of the artifact
        detection functions.
    n_iter_ : int
        If fit, the number of iterations required to complete ICA.

    Notes
    -----
    üé≠ Changed in version 0.23
        Version 0.23 introduced the ``max_iter='auto'`` settings for maximum
        iterations. With version 0.24 ``'auto'`` will be the new
        default, replacing the current ``max_iter=200``.

    üé≠ Changed in version 0.23
        Warn if `mne.Epochs` were baseline-corrected.

    üí° Note If you intend to fit ICA on `mne.Epochs`, it is  recommended to
              high-pass filter, but **not** baseline correct the data for good
              ICA performance. A warning will be emitted otherwise.

    A trailing ``_`` in an attribute name signifies that the attribute was
    added to the object during fitting, consistent with standard scikit-learn
    practice.

    ICA `fit` in MNE proceeds in two steps:

    1. :term:`Whitening <whitening>` the data by means of a pre-whitening step
       (using ``noise_cov`` if provided, or the standard deviation of each
       channel type) and then principal component analysis (PCA).
    2. Passing the ``n_components`` largest-variance components to the ICA
       algorithm to obtain the unmixing matrix (and by pseudoinversion, the
       mixing matrix).

    ICA `apply` then:

    1. Unmixes the data with the ``unmixing_matrix_``.
    2. Includes ICA components based on ``ica.include`` and ``ica.exclude``.
    3. Re-mixes the data with ``mixing_matrix_``.
    4. Restores any data not passed to the ICA algorithm, i.e., the PCA
       components between ``n_components`` and ``n_pca_components``.

    ``n_pca_components`` determines how many PCA components will be kept when
    reconstructing the data when calling `apply`. This parameter can be
    used for dimensionality reduction of the data, or dealing with low-rank
    data (such as those with projections, or MEG data processed by SSS). It is
    important to remove any numerically-zero-variance components in the data,
    otherwise numerical instability causes problems when computing the mixing
    matrix. Alternatively, using ``n_components`` as a float will also avoid
    numerical stability problems.

    The ``n_components`` parameter determines how many components out of
    the ``n_channels`` PCA components the ICA algorithm will actually fit.
    This is not typically used for EEG data, but for MEG data, it's common to
    use ``n_components < n_channels``. For example, full-rank
    306-channel MEG data might use ``n_components=40`` to find (and
    later exclude) only large, dominating artifacts in the data, but still
    reconstruct the data using all 306 PCA components. Setting
    ``n_pca_components=40``, on the other hand, would actually reduce the
    rank of the reconstructed data to 40, which is typically undesirable.

    If you are migrating from EEGLAB and intend to reduce dimensionality via
    PCA, similarly to EEGLAB's ``runica(..., 'pca', n)`` functionality,
    pass ``n_components=n`` during initialization and then
    ``n_pca_components=n`` during `apply`. The resulting reconstructed
    data after `apply` will have rank ``n``.

    üí° Note Commonly used for reasons of i) computational efficiency and
              ii) additional noise reduction, it is a matter of current debate
              whether pre-ICA dimensionality reduction could decrease the
              reliability and stability of the ICA, at least for EEG data and
              especially during preprocessing :footcite:`ArtoniEtAl2018`.
              (But see also :footcite:`Montoya-MartinezEtAl2017` for a
              possibly confounding effect of the different whitening/sphering
              methods used in this paper (ZCA vs. PCA).)
              On the other hand, for rank-deficient data such as EEG data after
              average reference or interpolation, it is recommended to reduce
              the dimensionality (by 1 for average reference and 1 for each
              interpolated channel) for optimal ICA performance (see the
              `EEGLAB wiki <eeglab_wiki_>`_).

    Caveat! If supplying a noise covariance, keep track of the projections
    available in the cov or in the raw object. For example, if you are
    interested in EOG or ECG artifacts, EOG and ECG projections should be
    temporally removed before fitting ICA, for example::

        >> projs, raw.info['projs'] = raw.info['projs'], []
        >> ica.fit(raw)
        >> raw.info['projs'] = projs

    Methods currently implemented are FastICA (default), Infomax, and Picard.
    Standard Infomax can be quite sensitive to differences in floating point
    arithmetic. Extended Infomax seems to be more stable in this respect,
    enhancing reproducibility and stability of results; use Extended Infomax
    via ``method='infomax', fit_params=dict(extended=True)``. Allowed entries
    in ``fit_params`` are determined by the various algorithm implementations:
    see `sklearn.decomposition.FastICA`, `picard.picard`,
    `mne.preprocessing.infomax`.

    üí° Note Picard can be used to solve the same problems as FastICA,
              Infomax, and extended Infomax, but typically converges faster
              than either of those methods. To make use of Picard's speed while
              still obtaining the same solution as with other algorithms, you
              need to specify ``method='picard'`` and ``fit_params`` as a
              dictionary with the following combination of keys:

              - ``dict(ortho=False, extended=False)`` for Infomax
              - ``dict(ortho=False, extended=True)`` for extended Infomax
              - ``dict(ortho=True, extended=True)`` for FastICA

    Reducing the tolerance (set in ``fit_params``) speeds up estimation at the
    cost of consistency of the obtained results. It is difficult to directly
    compare tolerance levels between Infomax and Picard, but for Picard and
    FastICA a good rule of thumb is ``tol_fastica == tol_picard ** 2``.

        Parameters
        ----------
        inst : instance of Raw or Epochs
            The data to be decomposed.
        picks : str | array-like | slice | None
            Channels to include. Slices and lists of integers will be interpreted as
            channel indices. In lists, channel *type* strings (e.g., ``['meg',
            'eeg']``) will pick channels of those types, channel *name* strings (e.g.,
            ``['MEG0111', 'MEG2623']`` will pick the given channels. Can also be the
            string values "all" to pick all channels, or "data" to pick :term:`data
            channels`. None (default) will pick good data channels (excluding reference
            MEG channels). Note that channels in ``info['bads']`` *will be included* if
            their names or indices are explicitly provided.
            This selection remains throughout the initialized ICA solution.
        start, stop : int | float | None
            First and last sample to include. If float, data will be
            interpreted as time in seconds. If ``None``, data will be used from
            the first sample and to the last sample, respectively.

            üí° Note These parameters only have an effect if ``inst`` is
                      `mne.io.Raw` data.
        decim : int | None
            Increment for selecting only each n-th sampling point. If ``None``,
            all samples  between ``start`` and ``stop`` (inclusive) are used.
        reject, flat : dict | None
            Rejection parameters based on peak-to-peak amplitude (PTP)
            in the continuous data. Signal periods exceeding the thresholds
            in ``reject`` or less than the thresholds in ``flat`` will be
            removed before fitting the ICA.

            üí° Note These parameters only have an effect if ``inst`` is
                      `mne.io.Raw` data. For `mne.Epochs`, perform PTP

                flat = None  # no rejection based on flatness
        tstep : float
            Length of data chunks for artifact rejection in seconds.

            üí° Note This parameter only has an effect if ``inst`` is
                      `mne.io.Raw` data.

        reject_by_annotation : bool
            Whether to omit bad segments from the data before fitting. If ``True``
            (default), annotated segments whose description begins with ``'bad'`` are
            omitted. If ``False``, no rejection based on annotations is performed.

        Notes
        -----
        ICA decomposition on MEG reference channels is used to assess external
        magnetic noise and remove it from the MEG. Two methods are supported:

        With the ``'together'`` method, only one ICA fit is used, which
        encompasses both MEG and reference channels together. Components which
        have particularly strong weights on the reference channels may be
        thresholded and marked for removal.

        With ``'separate'`` selected components from a separate ICA
        decomposition on the reference channels are used as a ground truth for
        identifying bad components in an ICA fit done on MEG channels only. The
        logic here is similar to an EOG/ECG, with reference components
        replacing the EOG/ECG channels. Recommended procedure is to perform ICA
        separately on reference channels, extract them using
        `mne.preprocessing.ICA.get_sources`, and then append them to the
        inst using `mne.io.Raw.add_channels`, preferably with the prefix
        ``REF_ICA`` so that they can be automatically detected.

        With ``'together'``, thresholding is based on adaptative z-scoring.

        With ``'separate'``:

        - If ``measure`` is ``'zscore'``, thresholding is based on adaptative
          z-scoring.
        - If ``measure`` is ``'correlation'``, threshold defines the absolute
          threshold on the correlation between 0 and 1.

        Validation and further documentation for this technique can be found
        in :footcite:`HannaEtAl2020`.

        the dynamics described by the excluded components is subtracted.

        Parameters
        ----------
        inst : instance of Raw, Epochs or Evoked
            The data to be processed (i.e., cleaned). It will be modified
            in-place.
        include : array_like of int
            The indices referring to columns in the ummixing matrix. The
            components to be kept. If ``None`` (default), all components
            will be included (minus those defined in ``ica.exclude``
            and the ``exclude`` parameter, see below).
        exclude : array_like of int
            The indices referring to columns in the ummixing matrix. The
            components to be zeroed out. If ``None`` (default) or an
            empty list, only components from ``ica.exclude`` will be
            excluded. Else, the union of ``exclude`` and ``ica.exclude``
            will be excluded.

        n_pca_components : int | float | None
            The number of PCA components to be kept, either absolute (int)
            or fraction of the explained variance (float). If None (default),
            the ``ica.n_pca_components`` from initialization will be used in 0.22;
            in 0.23 all components will be used.
        start : int | float | None
            First sample to include. If float, data will be interpreted as
            time in seconds. If None, data will be used from the first sample.
        stop : int | float | None
            Last sample to not include. If float, data will be interpreted as
            time in seconds. If None, data will be used to the last sample.

        on_baseline : str
            How to handle baseline-corrected epochs or evoked data.
            Can be ``'raise'`` to raise an error, ``'warn'`` (default) to emit a
            warning, ``'ignore'`` to ignore, or "reapply" to reapply the baseline
            after applying ICA.

            ‚ú® Added in version 1.2

        verbose : bool | str | int | None
            Control verbosity of the logging output. If ``None``, use the default
            verbosity level. See the `logging documentation <tut-logging>` and
            `mne.verbose` for details. Should only be passed as a keyword
            argument.

        Returns
        -------
        out : instance of Raw, Epochs or Evoked
            The processed data.

        Notes
        -----
        üí° Note Applying ICA may introduce a DC shift. If you pass
                  baseline-corrected `mne.Epochs` or `mne.Evoked` data,
                  the baseline period of the cleaned data may not be of
                  zero mean anymore. If you require baseline-corrected
                  data, apply baseline correction again after cleaning
                  via ICA. A warning will be emitted to remind you of this
                  fact if you pass baseline-corrected data.

        Parameters
        ----------
        picks : int | list of int | slice | None
            Indices of the independent components (ICs) to visualize.
            If an integer, represents the index of the IC to pick.
            Multiple ICs can be selected using a list of int or a slice.
            The indices are 0-indexed, so ``picks=1`` will pick the second
            IC: ``ICA001``. ``None`` will pick all independent components in the order
            fitted.
        ch_type : 'mag' | 'grad' | 'planar1' | 'planar2' | 'eeg' | None
            The channel type to plot. For ``'grad'``, the gradiometers are
            collected in pairs and the RMS for each pair is plotted. If
            ``None`` the first available channel type from order shown above is used. Defaults to ``None``.
        inst : Raw | Epochs | None
            To be able to see component properties after clicking on component
            topomap you need to pass relevant data - instances of Raw or Epochs
            (for example the data that ICA was trained on). This takes effect
            only when running matplotlib in interactive mode.
        plot_std : bool | float
            Whether to plot standard deviation in ERP/ERF and spectrum plots.
            Defaults to True, which plots one standard deviation above/below.
            If set to float allows to control how many standard deviations are
            plotted. For example 2.5 will plot 2.5 standard deviation above/below.
        reject : ``'auto'`` | dict | None
            Allows to specify rejection parameters used to drop epochs
            (or segments if continuous signal is passed as inst).
            If None, no rejection is applied. The default is 'auto',
            which applies the rejection parameters used when fitting
            the ICA object.

        sensors : bool | str
            Whether to add markers for sensor locations. If `str`, should be a
            valid matplotlib format string (e.g., ``'r+'`` for red plusses, see the
            Notes section of `matplotlib.axes.Axes.plot`). If ``True`` (the
            default), black circles will be used.

        show_names : bool | callable
            If ``True``, show channel names next to each sensor marker. If callable,
            channel names will be formatted using the callable; e.g., to
            delete the prefix 'MEG ' from all channel names, pass the function
            ``lambda x: x.replace('MEG ', '')``. If ``mask`` is not ``None``, only
            non-masked sensor names will be shown.

        contours : int | array-like
            The number of contour lines to draw. If ``0``, no contours will be drawn.
            If a positive integer, that number of contour levels are chosen using the
            matplotlib tick locator (may sometimes be inaccurate, use array for
            accuracy). If array-like, the array values are used as the contour levels.
            The values should be in ¬µV for EEG, fT for magnetometers and fT/m for
            gradiometers. If ``colorbar=True``, the colorbar will have ticks
            corresponding to the contour levels. Default is ``6``.

        outlines : 'head' | dict | None
            The outlines to be drawn. If 'head', the default head scheme will be
            drawn. If dict, each key refers to a tuple of x and y positions, the values
            in 'mask_pos' will serve as image mask.
            Alternatively, a matplotlib patch object can be passed for advanced
            masking options, either directly or as a function that returns patches
            (required for multi-axis plots). If None, nothing will be drawn.
            Defaults to 'head'.
        sphere : float | array-like | instance of ConductorModel | None  | 'auto' | 'eeglab'
            The sphere parameters to use for the head outline. Can be array-like of
            shape (4,) to give the X/Y/Z origin and radius in meters, or a single float
            to give just the radius (origin assumed 0, 0, 0). Can also be an instance
            of a spherical `mne.bem.ConductorModel` to use the origin and
            radius from that object. If ``'auto'`` the sphere is fit to digitization
            points. If ``'eeglab'`` the head circle is defined by EEG electrodes
            ``'Fpz'``, ``'Oz'``, ``'T7'``, and ``'T8'`` (if ``'Fpz'`` is not present,
            it will be approximated from the coordinates of ``'Oz'``). ``None`` (the
            default) is equivalent to ``'auto'`` when enough extra digitization points
            are available, and (0, 0, 0, 0.095) otherwise.

            ‚ú® Added in version 0.20
            üé≠ Changed in version 1.1 Added ``'eeglab'`` option.

        image_interp : str
            The image interpolation to be used. Options are ``'cubic'`` (default)
            to use `scipy.interpolate.CloughTocher2DInterpolator`,
            ``'nearest'`` to use `scipy.spatial.Voronoi` or
            ``'linear'`` to use `scipy.interpolate.LinearNDInterpolator`.

        extrapolate : str
            Options:

            - ``'box'``
                Extrapolate to four points placed to form a square encompassing all
                data points, where each side of the square is three times the range
                of the data in the respective dimension.
            - ``'local'`` (default for MEG sensors)
                Extrapolate only to nearby points (approximately to points closer than
                median inter-electrode distance). This will also set the
                mask to be polygonal based on the convex hull of the sensors.
            - ``'head'`` (default for non-MEG sensors)
                Extrapolate out to the edges of the clipping circle. This will be on
                the head circle when the sensors are contained within the head circle,
                but it can extend beyond the head when sensors are plotted outside
                the head circle.

            ‚ú® Added in version 1.3

        border : float | 'mean'
            Value to extrapolate to on the topomap borders. If ``'mean'`` (default),
            then each extrapolated point has the average value of its neighbours.

            ‚ú® Added in version 1.3

        res : int
            The resolution of the topomap image (number of pixels along each side).

        size : float
            Side length of each subplot in inches.

            ‚ú® Added in version 1.3

        cmap : matplotlib colormap | (colormap, bool) | 'interactive' | None
            Colormap to use. If `tuple`, the first value indicates the colormap
            to use and the second value is a boolean defining interactivity. In
            interactive mode the colors are adjustable by clicking and dragging the
            colorbar with left and right mouse button. Left mouse button moves the
            scale up and down and right mouse button adjusts the range. Hitting
            space bar resets the range. Up and down arrows can be used to change
            the colormap. If ``None``, ``'Reds'`` is used for data that is either
            all-positive or all-negative, and ``'RdBu_r'`` is used otherwise.
            ``'interactive'`` is equivalent to ``(None, True)``. Defaults to ``None``.

            ### ‚õîÔ∏è Warning  Interactive mode works smoothly only for a small amount
                of topomaps. Interactive mode is disabled by default for more than
                2 topomaps.

        vlim : tuple of length 2
            Colormap limits to use. If a `tuple` of floats, specifies the
            lower and upper bounds of the colormap (in that order); providing
            ``None`` for either entry will set the corresponding boundary at the
            min/max of the data. Defaults to ``(None, None)``.

            ‚ú® Added in version 1.3

        cnorm : matplotlib.colors.Normalize | None
            How to normalize the colormap. If ``None``, standard linear normalization
            is performed. If not ``None``, ``vmin`` and ``vmax`` will be ignored.
            See `Matplotlib docs <matplotlib:colormapnorms>`
            for more details on colormap normalization, and
            `the ERDs example<cnorm-example>` for an example of its use.

            ‚ú® Added in version 1.3

        colorbar : bool
            Plot a colorbar in the rightmost column of the figure.
        cbar_fmt : str
            Formatting string for colorbar tick labels. See `formatspec` for
            details.
        axes : Axes | array of Axes | None
            The subplot(s) to plot to. Either a single Axes or an iterable of Axes
            if more than one subplot is needed. The number of subplots must match
            the number of selected components. If None, new figures will be created
            with the number of subplots per figure controlled by ``nrows`` and
            ``ncols``.
        title : str | None
            The title of the generated figure. If ``None`` (default) and
            ``axes=None``, a default title of "ICA Components" will be used.

        nrows, ncols : int | 'auto'
            The number of rows and columns of topographies to plot. If both ``nrows``
            and ``ncols`` are ``'auto'``, will plot up to 20 components in a 5√ó4 grid,
            and return multiple figures if more than 20 components are requested.
            If one is ``'auto'`` and the other a scalar, a single figure is generated.
            If scalars are provided for both arguments, will plot up to ``nrows*ncols``
            components in a grid and return multiple figures as needed. Default is
            ``nrows='auto', ncols='auto'``.

            ‚ú® Added in version 1.3
        show : bool
            Show the figure if ``True``.
        image_args : dict | None
            Dictionary of arguments to pass to `mne.viz.plot_epochs_image`
            in interactive mode. Ignored if ``inst`` is not supplied. If ``None``,
            nothing is passed. Defaults to ``None``.
        psd_args : dict | None
            Dictionary of arguments to pass to `mne.Epochs.compute_psd` in
            interactive  mode. Ignored if ``inst`` is not supplied. If ``None``,
            nothing is passed. Defaults to ``None``.

        verbose : bool | str | int | None
            Control verbosity of the logging output. If ``None``, use the default
            verbosity level. See the `logging documentation <tut-logging>` and
            `mne.verbose` for details. Should only be passed as a keyword
            argument.

        Returns
        -------

            The figure object(s).

        Notes
        -----
        When run in interactive mode, ``plot_ica_components`` allows to reject
        components by clicking on their title label. The state of each component
        is indicated by its label color (gray: rejected; black: retained). It is
        also possible to open component properties by clicking on the component
        topomap (this option is only available when the ``inst`` argument is
        supplied).

            defaults to [7., 6.].
        show : bool
            Show figure if True.
        reject : 'auto' | dict | None
            Allows to specify rejection parameters used to drop epochs
            (or segments if continuous signal is passed as inst).
            If None, no rejection is applied. The default is 'auto',
            which applies the rejection parameters used when fitting
            the ICA object.

        reject_by_annotation : bool
            Whether to omit bad segments from the data before fitting. If ``True``
            (default), annotated segments whose description begins with ``'bad'`` are
            omitted. If ``False``, no rejection based on annotations is performed.

            Has no effect if ``inst`` is not a `mne.io.Raw` object.

        2. plot latent source around event related time windows (Epochs input)
        3. plot time-locking in ICA space (Evoked input)

        Parameters
        ----------
        inst : instance of Raw, Epochs or Evoked
            The object to plot the sources from.

        picks : int | list of int | slice | None
            Indices of the independent components (ICs) to visualize.
            If an integer, represents the index of the IC to pick.
            Multiple ICs can be selected using a list of int or a slice.
            The indices are 0-indexed, so ``picks=1`` will pick the second
            IC: ``ICA001``. ``None`` will pick all independent components in the order
            fitted.
        start, stop : float | int | None
           If ``inst`` is a `mne.io.Raw` or an `mne.Evoked` object, the first and
           last time point (in seconds) of the data to plot. If ``inst`` is a
           `mne.io.Raw` object, ``start=None`` and ``stop=None`` will be
           translated into ``start=0.`` and ``stop=3.``, respectively. For
           `mne.Evoked`, ``None`` refers to the beginning and end of the evoked
           signal. If ``inst`` is an `mne.Epochs` object, specifies the index of
           the first and last epoch to show.
        title : str | None
            The window title. If None a default is provided.
        show : bool
            Show figure if True.
        block : bool
            Whether to halt program execution until the figure is closed.
            Useful for interactive selection of components in raw and epoch
            plotter. For evoked, this parameter has no effect. Defaults to False.
        show_first_samp : bool
            If True, show time axis relative to the ``raw.first_samp``.

        show_scrollbars : bool
            Whether to show scrollbars when the plot is initialized. Can be toggled
            after initialization by pressing :kbd:`z` ("zen mode") while the plot
            window is focused. Default is ``True``.

            ‚ú® Added in version 0.19.0

        time_format : 'float' | 'clock'
            Style of time labels on the horizontal axis. If ``'float'``, labels will be
            number of seconds from the start of the recording. If ``'clock'``,
            labels will show "clock time" (hours/minutes/seconds) inferred from
            ``raw.info['meas_date']``. Default is ``'float'``.

            ‚ú® Added in version 0.24

        precompute : bool | str
            Whether to load all data (not just the visible portion) into RAM and
            apply preprocessing (e.g., projectors) to the full data array in a separate
            processor thread, instead of window-by-window during scrolling. The default
            None uses the ``MNE_BROWSER_PRECOMPUTE`` variable, which defaults to
            ``'auto'``. ``'auto'`` compares available RAM space to the expected size of
            the precomputed data, and precomputes only if enough RAM is available.
            This is only used with the Qt backend.

            ‚ú® Added in version 0.24
            üé≠ Changed in version 1.0
               Support for the MNE_BROWSER_PRECOMPUTE config variable.

        use_opengl : bool | None
            Whether to use OpenGL when rendering the plot (requires ``pyopengl``).
            May increase performance, but effect is dependent on system CPU and
            graphics hardware. Only works if using the Qt backend. Default is
            None, which will use False unless the user configuration variable
            ``MNE_BROWSER_USE_OPENGL`` is set to ``'true'``,
            see `mne.set_config`.

            ‚ú® Added in version 0.24

        theme : str | path-like
            Can be "auto", "light", or "dark" or a path-like to a
            custom stylesheet. For Dark-Mode and automatic Dark-Mode-Detection,
            `qdarkstyle <https://github.com/ColinDuquesnoy/QDarkStyleSheet>`__ and
            `darkdetect <https://github.com/albertosottile/darkdetect>`__,

            defaulting to "auto" if it's not found.
            Only supported by the ``'qt'`` backend.

            ‚ú® Added in version 1.0

        overview_mode : str | None
            Can be "channels", "empty", or "hidden" to set the overview bar mode
            for the ``'qt'`` backend. If None (default), the config option
            ``MNE_BROWSER_OVERVIEW_MODE`` will be used, defaulting to "channels"
            if it's not found.

            ‚ú® Added in version 1.1

        splash : bool
            If True (default), a splash screen is shown during the application startup. Only
            applicable to the ``qt`` backend.

            ‚ú® Added in version 1.6

        Returns
        -------

        fig : matplotlib.figure.Figure | mne_qt_browser.figure.MNEQtBrowser
            Browser instance.

        Notes
        -----
        For raw and epoch instances, it is possible to select components for
        exclusion by clicking on the line. The selected components are added to
        ``ica.exclude`` on close.

        MNE-Python provides two different backends for browsing plots (i.e.,
        `raw.plot()<mne.io.Raw.plot>`, `epochs.plot()<mne.Epochs.plot>`,
        and `ica.plot_sources()<mne.preprocessing.ICA.plot_sources>`). One is
        based on `matplotlib`, and the other is based on
        :doc:`PyQtGraph<pyqtgraph:index>`. You can set the backend temporarily with the
        context manager `mne.viz.use_browser_backend`, you can set it for the
        duration of a Python session using `mne.viz.set_browser_backend`, and you
        can set the default for your computer via
        `mne.set_config('MNE_BROWSER_BACKEND', 'matplotlib')<mne.set_config>`
        (or ``'qt'``).

        üí° Note For the PyQtGraph backend to run in IPython with ``block=False``
                  you must run the magic command ``%gui qt5`` first.
        üí° Note To report issues with the PyQtGraph backend, please use the
                  `issues <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-qt-browser/issues>`_
