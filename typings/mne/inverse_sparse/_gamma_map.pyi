    """Hierarchical Bayes (Gamma-MAP) sparse source localization method.

    Models each source time course using a zero-mean Gaussian prior with an
    unknown variance (gamma) parameter. During estimation, most gammas are
    driven to zero, resulting in a sparse source estimate, as in
    :footcite:`WipfEtAl2007` and :footcite:`WipfNagarajan2009`.

    For fixed-orientation forward operators, a separate gamma is used for each
    source time course, while for free-orientation forward operators, the same
    gamma is used for the three source time courses at each source space point
    (separate gammas can be used in this case by using xyz_same_gamma=False).

    Parameters
    ----------
    evoked : instance of Evoked
        Evoked data to invert.
    forward : dict
        Forward operator.
    noise_cov : instance of Covariance
        Noise covariance to compute whitener.
    alpha : float
        Regularization parameter (noise variance).

    loose : float | 'auto' | dict
        Value that weights the source variances of the dipole components
        that are parallel (tangential) to the cortical surface. Can be:

        - float between 0 and 1 (inclusive)
            If 0, then the solution is computed with fixed orientation.
            If 1, it corresponds to free orientations.
        - ``'auto'`` (default)
            Uses 0.2 for surface source spaces (unless ``fixed`` is True) and
            1.0 for other source spaces (volume or mixed).
        - dict
            Mapping from the key for a given source space type (surface, volume,
            discrete) to the loose value. Useful mostly for mixed source spaces.

    depth : None | float | dict
        How to weight (or normalize) the forward using a depth prior.
        If float (default 0.8), it acts as the depth weighting exponent (``exp``)
        to use None is equivalent to 0, meaning no depth weighting is performed.
        It can also be a `dict` containing keyword arguments to pass to
        `mne.forward.compute_depth_prior` (see docstring for details and
        defaults). This is effectively ignored when ``method='eLORETA'``.

        ðŸŽ­ Changed in version 0.20
           Depth bias ignored for ``method='eLORETA'``.
    xyz_same_gamma : bool
        Use same gamma for xyz current components at each source space point.
        Recommended for free-orientation forward solutions.
    maxit : int
        Maximum number of iterations.
    tol : float
        Tolerance parameter for convergence.
    update_mode : int
        Update mode, 1: MacKay update (default), 2: Modified MacKay update.
    gammas : array, shape=(n_sources,)
        Initial values for posterior variances (gammas). If None, a
        variance of 1.0 is used.
    pca : bool
        If True the rank of the data is reduced to the true dimension.
    return_residual : bool
        If True, the residual is returned as an Evoked instance.
    return_as_dipoles : bool
        If True, the sources are returned as a list of Dipole instances.

    rank : None | 'info' | 'full' | dict
        This controls the rank computation that can be read from the
        measurement info or estimated from the data. When a noise covariance
        is used for whitening, this should reflect the rank of that covariance,
        otherwise amplification of noise components can occur in whitening (e.g.,
        often during source localization).

        :data:`python:None`
            The rank will be estimated from the data after proper scaling of
            different channel types.
        ``'info'``
            The rank is inferred from ``info``. If data have been processed
            with Maxwell filtering, the Maxwell filtering header is used.
            Otherwise, the channel counts themselves are used.
            In both cases, the number of projectors is subtracted from
            the (effective) number of channels in the data.
            For example, if Maxwell filtering reduces the rank to 68, with
            two projectors the returned value will be 66.
        ``'full'``
            The rank is assumed to be full, i.e. equal to the
            number of good channels. If a `mne.Covariance` is passed, this can
            make sense if it has been (possibly improperly) regularized without
            taking into account the true data rank.
        `dict`
            Calculate the rank only for a subset of channel types, and explicitly
            specify the rank for the remaining channel types. This can be
            extremely useful if you already **know** the rank of (part of) your
            data, for instance in case you have calculated it earlier.

            This parameter must be a dictionary whose **keys** correspond to
            channel types in the data (e.g. ``'meg'``, ``'mag'``, ``'grad'``,
            ``'eeg'``), and whose **values** are integers representing the
            respective ranks. For example, ``{'mag': 90, 'eeg': 45}`` will assume
            a rank of ``90`` and ``45`` for magnetometer data and EEG data,
            respectively.

            The ranks for all channel types present in the data, but
            **not** specified in the dictionary will be estimated empirically.
            That is, if you passed a dataset containing magnetometer, gradiometer,
            and EEG data together with the dictionary from the previous example,
            only the gradiometer rank would be determined, while the specified
            magnetometer and EEG ranks would be taken for granted.

        The default is ``None``.

        âœ¨ Added in version 0.18

    pick_ori : None | "normal" | "vector"

        Options:

        - ``None``
            Pooling is performed by taking the norm of loose/free
            orientations. In case of a fixed source space no norm is computed
            leading to signed source activity.
        - ``"normal"``
            Only the normal to the cortical surface is kept. This is only
            implemented when working with loose orientations.

        - ``"vector"``
            No pooling of the orientations is done, and the vector result
            will be returned in the form of a `mne.VectorSourceEstimate`
            object.

    verbose : bool | str | int | None
        Control verbosity of the logging output. If ``None``, use the default
        verbosity level. See the `logging documentation <tut-logging>` and
        `mne.verbose` for details. Should only be passed as a keyword
        argument.

    Returns
    -------
    stc : instance of SourceEstimate
        Source time courses.
    residual : instance of Evoked
        The residual a.k.a. data not explained by the sources.
        Only returned if return_residual is True.
