    ### üìñ Notes
    -----
    Currently only the ``method='eLORETA'`` has additional options.
    It performs an iterative fit with a convergence criterion, so you can
    pass a ``method_params`` `dict` with string keys mapping to values
    for:

        'eps' : float
            The convergence epsilon (default 1e-6).
        'max_iter' : int
            The maximum number of iterations (default 20).
            If less regularization is applied, more iterations may be
            necessary.
        'force_equal' : bool
            Force all eLORETA weights for each direction for a given
            location equal. The default is None, which means ``True`` for
            loose-orientation inverses and ``False`` for free- and
            fixed-orientation inverses. See below.

    The eLORETA paper :footcite:`Pascual-Marqui2011` defines how to compute
    inverses for fixed- and
    free-orientation inverses. In the free orientation case, the X/Y/Z
    orientation triplet for each location is effectively multiplied by a
    3x3 weight matrix. This is the behavior obtained with
    ``force_equal=False`` parameter.

    However, other noise normalization methods (dSPM, sLORETA) multiply all
    orientations for a given location by a single value.
    Using ``force_equal=True`` mimics this behavior by modifying the iterative
    algorithm to choose uniform weights (equivalent to a 3x3 diagonal matrix
    with equal entries).

    It is necessary to use ``force_equal=True``
    with loose orientation inverses (e.g., ``loose=0.2``), otherwise the
    solution resembles a free-orientation inverse (``loose=1.0``).
    It is thus recommended to use ``force_equal=True`` for loose orientation
    and ``force_equal=False`` for free orientation inverses. This is the
    behavior used when the parameter ``force_equal=None`` (default behavior).

        Use minimum norm, dSPM (default), sLORETA, or eLORETA.

    pick_ori : None | "normal"

        Options:

        - ``None``
            Pooling is performed by taking the norm of loose/free
            orientations. In case of a fixed source space no norm is computed
            leading to signed source activity.
        - ``"normal"``
            Only the normal to the cortical surface is kept. This is only
            implemented when working with loose orientations.
    prepared : bool
        If True, do not call `prepare_inverse_operator`.
    label : Label | None
        Restricts the source estimates to a given label. If None,
        source estimates will be computed for the entire source space.
    method_params : dict | None
        Additional options for eLORETA. See Notes for details.

    use_cps : bool
        Whether to use cortical patch statistics to define normal orientations for
        surfaces (default True).

    verbose : bool | str | int | None
        Control verbosity of the logging output. If ``None``, use the default
        verbosity level. See the `logging documentation <tut-logging>` and
        `mne.verbose` for details. Should only be passed as a keyword
        argument.

    ### üõ†Ô∏è Parameters
    ----------

    info : mne.Info
        The `mne.Info` object with information about the sensors and methods of measurement.
        Specifies the channels to include. Bad channels (in ``info['bads']``)
        are not used.
    forward : instance of Forward
        Forward operator. See `mne.make_forward_solution` to create the operator.
    noise_cov : instance of Covariance
        The noise covariance matrix. See `mne.compute_raw_covariance` and
        `mne.compute_covariance` to compute the noise covariance matrix on
        `mne.io.Raw` and `mne.Epochs` respectively.

    loose : float | 'auto' | dict
        Value that weights the source variances of the dipole components
        that are parallel (tangential) to the cortical surface. Can be:

        - float between 0 and 1 (inclusive)
            If 0, then the solution is computed with fixed orientation.
            If 1, it corresponds to free orientations.
        - ``'auto'`` (default)
            Uses 0.2 for surface source spaces (unless ``fixed`` is True) and
            1.0 for other source spaces (volume or mixed).
        - dict
            Mapping from the key for a given source space type (surface, volume,
            discrete) to the loose value. Useful mostly for mixed source spaces.

    depth : None | float | dict
        How to weight (or normalize) the forward using a depth prior.
        If float (default 0.8), it acts as the depth weighting exponent (``exp``)
        to use None is equivalent to 0, meaning no depth weighting is performed.
        It can also be a `dict` containing keyword arguments to pass to
        `mne.forward.compute_depth_prior` (see docstring for details and
        defaults). This is effectively ignored when ``method='eLORETA'``.

        üé≠ Changed in version 0.20
           Depth bias ignored for ``method='eLORETA'``.
    fixed : bool | 'auto'
        Use fixed source orientations normal to the cortical mantle. If True,
        the loose parameter must be ``"auto"`` or ``0``. If ``'auto'``, the loose value
        is used.

    rank : None | 'info' | 'full' | dict
        This controls the rank computation that can be read from the
        measurement info or estimated from the data. When a noise covariance
        is used for whitening, this should reflect the rank of that covariance,
        otherwise amplification of noise components can occur in whitening (e.g.,
        often during source localization).

        :data:`python:None`
            The rank will be estimated from the data after proper scaling of
            different channel types.
        ``'info'``
            The rank is inferred from ``info``. If data have been processed
            with Maxwell filtering, the Maxwell filtering header is used.
            Otherwise, the channel counts themselves are used.
            In both cases, the number of projectors is subtracted from
            the (effective) number of channels in the data.
            For example, if Maxwell filtering reduces the rank to 68, with
            two projectors the returned value will be 66.
        ``'full'``
            The rank is assumed to be full, i.e. equal to the
            number of good channels. If a `mne.Covariance` is passed, this can
            make sense if it has been (possibly improperly) regularized without
            taking into account the true data rank.
        `dict`
            Calculate the rank only for a subset of channel types, and explicitly
            specify the rank for the remaining channel types. This can be
            extremely useful if you already **know** the rank of (part of) your
            data, for instance in case you have calculated it earlier.

            This parameter must be a dictionary whose **keys** correspond to
            channel types in the data (e.g. ``'meg'``, ``'mag'``, ``'grad'``,
            ``'eeg'``), and whose **values** are integers representing the
            respective ranks. For example, ``{'mag': 90, 'eeg': 45}`` will assume
            a rank of ``90`` and ``45`` for magnetometer data and EEG data,
            respectively.

            The ranks for all channel types present in the data, but
            **not** specified in the dictionary will be estimated empirically.
            That is, if you passed a dataset containing magnetometer, gradiometer,
            and EEG data together with the dictionary from the previous example,
            only the gradiometer rank would be determined, while the specified
            magnetometer and EEG ranks would be taken for granted.

        The default is ``None``.

    use_cps : bool
        Whether to use cortical patch statistics to define normal orientations for
        surfaces (default True).

    verbose : bool | str | int | None
        Control verbosity of the logging output. If ``None``, use the default
        verbosity level. See the `logging documentation <tut-logging>` and
        `mne.verbose` for details. Should only be passed as a keyword
        argument.

    ### ‚èé Returns
    -------
    inv : instance of InverseOperator
        Inverse operator.

    ### üìñ Notes
    -----
    For different sets of options (**loose**, **depth**, **fixed**) to work,
    the forward operator must have been loaded using a certain configuration
    (i.e., with **force_fixed** and **surf_ori** set appropriately). For
    example, given the desired inverse type (with representative choices
    of **loose** = 0.2 and **depth** = 0.8 shown in the table in various
    places, as these are the defaults for those parameters):

        +---------------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------------+--------------+
        | | Free orientation  | 1.0       | None      | False     | False           | True | False |
        +---------------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------------+--------------+
        | | Fixed constraint, | 0.0       | 0.8       | True      | False           | True         |
        | | Depth weighted    |           |           |           |                 |              |
        +---------------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------------+--------------+
        | | Fixed constraint  | 0.0       | None      | True      | True            | True         |
        +---------------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------------+--------------+

    Also note that, if the source space (as stored in the forward solution)
    has patch statistics computed, these are used to improve the depth
    weighting. Thus slightly different results are to be expected with
    and without this information.

    For depth weighting, 0.8 is generally good for MEG, and between 2 and 5
    is good for EEG, see :footcite:t:`LinEtAl2006a`.

        The SNR estimated using the mismatch between the unregularized

    ### üìñ Notes
    -----
    ``snr_est`` is estimated by using different amounts of inverse
    regularization and checking the mismatch between predicted and
    measured whitened data.

    In more detail, given our whitened inverse obtained from SVD:

    .. math::

        \\tilde{M} = R^\\frac{1}{2}V\\Gamma U^T

    The values in the diagonal matrix :math:`\\Gamma` are expressed in terms
    of the chosen regularization :math:`\\lambda^2 \\sim 1/\\rm{SNR}^2`
    and singular values :math:`\\lambda_k` as:

    .. math::

        \\gamma_k = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_k}\\frac{\\lambda_k^2}{\\lambda_k^2 + \\lambda^2}

    We also know that our predicted data is given by:

    .. math::

        \\hat{x}(t) = G\\hat{j}(t)=C^\\frac{1}{2}U\\Pi w(t)

    And thus our predicted whitened data is just:

    .. math::

        \\hat{w}(t) = U\\Pi w(t)

    Where :math:`\\Pi` is diagonal with entries entries:

    .. math::

        \\lambda_k\\gamma_k = \\frac{\\lambda_k^2}{\\lambda_k^2 + \\lambda^2}

    If we use no regularization, note that :math:`\\Pi` is just the
    identity matrix. Here we test the squared magnitude of the difference
    between unregularized solution and regularized solutions, choosing the
    biggest regularization that achieves a :math:`\\chi^2`-test significance
    of 0.001.
